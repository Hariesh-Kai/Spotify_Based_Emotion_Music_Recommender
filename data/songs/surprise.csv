Beautiful South,/b/beautiful+south/poppy_20015260.html,Poppy,"'I fought hard in the Second World War'  
You hear them shout  
No good bragging about the Afrika Korps  
It was Beadle's About  
  
They dressed you up and took you off to World War One  
Armed you and surrounded you with wire  
Sat in stinking mud you sung your stupid songs  
And waited till they told you when to fire  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
Nothing makes them laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
From the First World War to the Yom-Kippur  
It was Beadle's About  
The bayonets slice, the rockets roar  
And he jumps out  
  
Fond memories of the bloody bridge you failed to hold  
Many of your buddies killed or maimed  
You would've shot at rabbits if that's what you'd been told  
Till the General said 'I'm sorry you've been framed'  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning  
Because you're sure to get a laugh  
With a video bloodbath  
Nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Here's a wacky video we got last week  
A bomb catches Arthur unawares  
He's lost both his arms and he can't see or speak  
But thank you for the memory you shared  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning  
Because you're sure to get a laugh  
With a video bloodbath  
Nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath

Bill Withers,/b/bill+withers/hello+like+before_20214309.html,Hello Like Before,"Hello like before  
I'd never come here  
If I'd known that you were here  
I must admit though  
That's it's nice to see you, dear  
You look like you've been doing well  
  
Hello like before  
I hope we've grown  
'Cause we were only children then  
For laughs I guess we both can say  
'I knew when'  
But then again, that's kiss and tell  
  
Hello like before  
I guess it's different  
'Cause we know each other now  
I guess I've always known  
We'd meet again somehow  
So that it might as well be now

Blur,/b/blur/best+days_20021000.html,Best Days,"Bow bells say goodbye to the last train  
Over the river they all go again  
Out into leafy nowhere hope someone  
Waiting out there for them  
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun  
He works nights but it's not much fun  
Picks up the London yo-yo's, all on their own down Soho  
Please take me home  
  
Other people wouldn't want to hear you  
If you said that these are the best days of their lives  
Other people would turn around an d laugh at you  
If you said that these were the best days of our lives  
  
Trellick Tower's been calling  
I know she'll leave me in the morning  
  
In hotel cells listening to dial tones  
Remote controls and cable moans  
In his drink he's been talking  
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home

Bon Jovi,/b/bon+jovi/kidnap+an+angel_20806349.html,Kidnap An Angel,"I get up every morning, drink coffee alone  
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more  
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
  
I get in the car like I do every day  
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?  
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there  
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel  
  
He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood  
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel

Carly Simon,/c/carly+simon/half+a+chance_20027219.html,Half A Chance,"You said we'd light the firmament  
You said our love was permanent  
You said we'd stick through thick and thin  
Through up and down, through lose and win  
But comes the first sign of stormy weather  
You're packin' your bags in the trance  
But you gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance  
  
you can't pretend it's Camelot  
Then start to run when things get hot  
When love explodes there's always heat  
There's always bitter with the sweet  
There's always times when your legs feel broken  
But you still don't drop out of the dance  
You gotta give  
  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
Half a chance  
To our romance

Cher,/c/cher/after+all_10061527.html,After All,"Well, here we are again  
I guess it must be fate  
We've tried it on our own  
But deep inside we've known  
We'd be back to set things straight  
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new  
Every memory repeats  
Every step I take retreats  
Every journey always brings me back to you  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all  
  
When love is truly right  
(This time it's truly right)  
It lives from year to year  
It changes as it goes  
Oh, and on the way it grows  
But it never disappears  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all  
  
Always just beyond my touch  
You know I needed you so much  
After all, what else is livin' for?  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Chicago,/c/chicago/poem+for+the+people_20029848.html,Poem For The People,"If the people only knew  
If they could visualize  
Just open their eyes  
Even stop to think about  
  
If they could open their minds  
They could get beyond  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
  
Is rarely funny  
Rarely funny  
Could the people understand  
In only whisper and screams  
  
And colorless dreams  
Could they finally comprehend  
If they could suddenly see  
  
And suddenly feel  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
Is rarely funny

Feel alright ''cause I'm doing as I should,  
Don't look back,no I don't have the time,

Got no bags to slow me down,  
Travelling light but my feet are on the ground,  
Got no message,I ain't got a dime,  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
  
Don't need no paper telling me bad news,  
No politician giving their views,  
Don't need no doctor to tell me I'm well,  
I feel like heaven and I've been through hell.  
  
Talking straight I don't feel confused,  
Don't want nothing,I've got nothing more to lose,  
Don't need no credit,don't show me where to sign,  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
  
Don't come looking for me,  
'Cause I'm doing fine,  
No missing persons,  
''cause I'm doing fine,  
Don't go home,  
'cause I'm doing fine.

Funny, how time can fly right through you fingers  
When the parade passes by, you know it's too late then  
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door  
Down the stairs, out on the street, it won't be coming back  
It won't be coming back anymore  
Take a chance to be a hero, a chance to play in this game  
A chance to be somebody who you're gonna recognize my name  
A chance to be a hero, a shot at the big time  
A chance to be somebody new, a chance to be a hero  
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door  
Down the stairs, out on the street, it won't be coming back  
It won't be coming back anymore  
Take a chance to be a hero, a chance to play in this game  
A chance to be somebody who you're gonna recognize my name  
A chance to be a hero, a shot at the big time  
A chance to be somebody new, I only wanna be  
Only wanna be, I wanna be a hero

Engelbert Humperdinck,/e/engelbert+humperdinck/when+you+say+nothing+at+all_20504130.html,When You Say Nothing At All,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.  
Without saying a word you can light up the dark.  
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.  
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.  
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud,  
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.  
Old Mister Webster could never define  
what's being said between your heart and mine.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.  
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.  
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.

Fiona Apple,/f/fiona+apple/window_10116241.html,Window,"I was staring out the window  
The whole time he was talking to me  
It was a filthy pane of glass  
I couldn't get a clear view  
  
As he went on and on  
It wasn't the outside world I could see  
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I was never focused on just one thing  
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft  
It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view  
  
But I'm as good as asleep  
I bet you didn't know  
It takes a lot of it away if you do  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
Because the fact in fact  
Whatever's in front of me is covering my view  
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact  
I only see what I'm looking through  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
So again I've done the right thing  
I was never worried about that  
The answer's always been in clear view  
But even when the window's clean  
I still can't see for the fact  
That when it's clean it's so clear  
I can't tell what I'm looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
I had to break the window  
It was in my way  
Better that I break a window  
Then forget what I had to say

And the moon and the stars

Finers started snappin'  
He laughed jumpin' Jupiter  
This is happenin'  
  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He said,""Let the dance begin!""  
  
He made the birds of the air  
The fish of the sea  
The beasts of the field,  
Adam and Eve  
He worked six days long  
Gettin' it right  
Then,just for fun he made Saturday night  
  
He hollered,  
""Gabriel,grab your horn and call some friends""  
And then all the saints came marchin' on in  
  
Doin' the Big Bang Boogie  
The Big Bang Boogie  
They did the Big Bang Boogie

When your all stressed up with no place to go  
There is a timeless place you already know  
It's your inner space honey  
Your greatest frontier and the sound of silence you just might hear

Louis Jordan,/l/louis+jordan/saturday+night+fish+fry_20835400.html,Saturday Night Fish Fry,"Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans  
Then you can understand just what I mean  
All through the week, it's quiet as a mouse  
But on Saturday night, they go from house to house  
  
You don't have to pay the usual admission  
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician  
So if you happen to be just passin' by  
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem  
Foolin' around just me and him  
We decided we could use a little something to eat  
So we went to a house on Rampart Street  
  
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease  
And a lush little miss said, ""Come in, please""  
And before we could even bat an eye  
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life  
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife  
Over in the corner was a beat up grand  
Being played by a big fat piano man  
  
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks  
Some of them had on bobbie socks  
But everybody was nice and high  
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'  
The bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'  
And way up above all the noise they made  
Somebody hollered, ""Better get out of here, this is a raid""  
  
Now I didn't know we was breakin' the law  
But somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw  
They had us blocked off from the front to the back  
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potato sacks  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
I knew I could get away if I had a chance  
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance  
Now I tried to crawl under a bathtub  
When the policeman said, ""Where you goin' there, bub?""  
  
Now they got us out of there like a house afire  
Put us all in that Black Maria  
Now, they might have missed a pitiful few  
But they got poor me and my buddy too  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
We headed for jail in a dazed condition  
They booked each one of us on suspicion  
Now my chick came down and went for my bail  
And finally got me out of that rotten jail  
  
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye  
Just mention a Saturday night fish fry  
I don't care how many fish in the sea  
But don't ever mention a fish to me  
  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
It was rockin', it was rockin'  
You never seen such scufflin'  
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn  
  
Give me one of them, their fish sandwiches  
Get away from there, boy, yowza

Take it with both your hands and be somebody for a day

They told me that the wiring  
Was somehow all misfiring  
And screwing up the signals in my brain.  
  
And then they told me chemistry -  
The juice and not the circuitry -  
Was mixing up and making me insane.  
  
What happens if the burn has healed  
But the skin has not regrown?  
What happens if the cast at last comes off  
And then you find the break  
Was always in another bone?  
  
They tried a millions meds and  
They strapped me to their beds and  
They shrugged and told me that's the way it goes.  
  
And finally you hit it.  
I asked you just what did it.  
You shrugged and said that no one really knows.  
  
What happens if the medicine wasn't really in control?  
What happens if the cut, the burn, the break  
Was never in my brain, or in my blood, but in my soul?

And every boy was captured diggin' for gold  
Poor old Jefferson was left in the snow  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
Jefferson is always on my mind  
When him and me were runnin' out of time  
Jefferson was sure enough left behind  
The cops came in and took him by surprise  
That night when Sally really showed her game  
The neighbourhood would never be the same  
Poor old Jefferson got the blame  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
I do believe he didn't do wrong  
I say a prayer for someone I care for  
  
That night where Sally really gave it all  
And made us small boys look quite tall  
Poor old Jefferson left the ball

By your keys  
Was a book of numbers

Surely will screen out the sorrow  
But where are you tomorrow

Lookin' so outrageous  
And they tell you so  
You should know  
How all the pros play the game  
You change your name

On the run  
You will stagger homeward  
To your precious one

Who must make everything right  
Talk it out till daylight

And now I know I'm not sleeping  
No the searching is over and baby I've found  
That this is the easiest thing to do  
It's the easiest thing to do  
It's as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin' you  
Suddenly the sadness is gone  
And I don't have to tell myself  
To struggle through  
To carry on  
This is the easiest thing to do  
It's the easiest thing to do  
It's as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in

Wed meet again for I had told you

Counting Crows,/c/counting+crows/outside+chance_20313129.html,Outside Chance,"(Original by The Turtles - written by Warron Zevon )  
  
You can try to please me  
But it won't be easy  
Stone walls surround me  
I'm surprised that you even found me  
Chorus:  
And you don't stand an outside chance  
(you don't stand an outside chance)  
You don't stand an outside chance  
But you can try  
Whatever you do girl  
You know you can't get through girl  
Can't bring me down  
Hang me up or even hang around  
[repeat chorus]  
I know you think you'll get me  
I'm only flesh and bone  
But you may as well forget me  
'Cause my heart is stone  
You better leave me alone  
Stand an outside chance

When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat  
You pray a great white whale might come your way  
  
No freeway traffic in the frozen North  
Just a chain link fence full of birds  
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay  
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail

When you ride that whale  
  
In a crumbling city we were trapped for days  
With a broken sun above the clouds  
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down  
And a sign on the wall says, ""Hope Allowed""  
  
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone  
A far cry from a tattooed rose  
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind  
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation

Somebody shouted  
Maybe  
But they kept on living from hand to mouth  
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth  
  
So she ran to the arms of America  
And she kissed the powers that be  
And someone told me

Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.

Ain't nothin' like them in the whole wide world.

Of having what you want

Beauty at it's best but never a trace of

That's how it always goes  
I came into this thing with my heart in a spin  
I went out with a broken nose  
  
You win, I lose  
That's how it's meant to be  
Well I tried all I can just to figure it out  
But love's just mystery  
  
Guess all you ladies would call me easy  
But I'm a fool for the femme fatale  
When she flashes those eyes I'm not a man I'm a mouse  
Tryin' to patch up a broken heart  
  
You win, I lose  
That's okay that's the way it goes  
Well I tried all I could but it did me no good  
'Cause all I've got is nothin' to show  
  
They say that men are always supposed to act  
Like they're not really tryin'  
But when I come on cool nobody seems to notice  
It's a mystery  
It's a mystery to me  
  
You see you win, I lose  
I guess that's how we're meant to be  
I tried as hard as I could but it did me no good  
You're more than a match for me  
And it don't make no sense to me  
Love is still a mystery  
It's just a mystery

I can see you in my minds rose-tinted eye..  
Somewhere you're drifting by  
Your heels rolling sparks on the lucky street  
  
While here am I, left behind  
Stunned and blind  
But I can see you from here  
I can see you so clear  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours together  
  
You're gone, and heaven cries.  
A thunderstorm breaks from the northern sky  
Chasing you back to the daily grind  
  
You're gone. And where am I?  
A haunted life  
The ghost of your laughter  
The half-empty glass  
The half-empty glass  
  
And I wait  
'Til midnight tolls  
Two souls almost touching in the dark  
I'll be allright

Is I stayed there once and I almost fit

In your sizzling shoes in my dreams

He had a colt. 45 and a deck of cards  
Stagger lee  
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat  
Had a '28 ford, had payments on that  
Stagger lee  
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow  
And told him, never ever come back no more  
Stagger lee  
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the  
Mud  
Till he came to a place called the bucket of blood  
Stagger lee  
He said mr motherfucker, you know who I am

Goddamn  
To stagger lee  
He said, well bartender, it's plain to see  
I'm that bad motherfucker called stagger lee

Way  
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day  
Mr stagger lee  
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said  
'cause stag put four holes in his motherfucking head  
Just then in came a broad called nellie brown  
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town  
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt  
Over to stagger lee, she starts to flirt  
With stagger lee  
She saw the barkeep, said, o god, he can't be  
Dead!  
Stag said, well, just count the holes in the  
Motherfucker's head  
She said, you ain't look like you scored in quite a  
Time.  
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime  
Mr. Stagger lee  
But there's something I have to say before you  
Begin  
You'll have to be gone before my man billy dilly comes  
In,  
Mr. Stagger lee  
I'll stay here till billy comes in, till time comes  
To pass  
And furthermore I'll fuck billy in his motherfucking  
Ass  
Said stagger lee  
I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know  
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one  
Fat boy's asshole  
Said stagger lee  
Just then billy dilly rolls in and he says, you  
Must be  
That bad motherfucker called stagger lee

Yeah, I'm stagger lee and you better get down on  
Your knees  
And suck my dick, because if you don't you're gonna be

Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.  
I cried, take me please!  
  
Ice, it was shining.  
I could feel my heart, it was melting.  
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.  
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.  
I cried, break it up, oh, now I understand.  
Break it up, and I want to go.  
Break it up, oh please take me with you.  
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.  
  
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.  
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.  
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up  
Break it up, break it up, break it on up  
Break it up, break it on up, up, up  
Break it, break it, break it, break it  
Break it on up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up

I didn't know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there  
  
Ooh, then I suddenly see you,  
Ooh, did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
  
You didn't run, you didn't lie  
You knew I wanted just to hold you  
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again  
For I had told you  
  
Ooh, you were meant to be near me  
Ooh, and I want you hear me  
Say we'll be together every day  
  
Got to get you into my life  
What can I do, what can I be,  
When I'm with you I want to stay there  
If I'm true I'll never leave  
And if I do I know the way there  
  
Ooh, then I suddenly see you,  
Ooh, did I tell you I need you

Did I tell you I need you...

Perry Como,/p/perry+como/i+looked+back_20235852.html,I Looked Back,"You looked back to see if I looked back,  
And I looked back to see if you looked back  
To see if I looked back to see  
If you were lookin' at me!  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
When you looked back I felt my heart strings snap,  
And heard a thunder clap  
And saw the lightning striking at me!  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
( . . . to see if you were lookin' at me! )  
To see if I was lookin' at you, lookin' at me,  
Lookin' at you . . . lookin' at me!

Drinking in another club or driving in your car  
Walking through empty streets  
Stupid fool, that was yours for keeps

Come on, tell me one more time

Just to find a little peace of mind there  
If you give up your affairs forever  
I will give up mine  
But it's hard  
So hard  
  
I'm always hoping you'll be faithful  
But you're not, I suppose  
We've both given up smoking 'cause it's fatal  
So whose matches are those?

Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn

That the slaves put down, while breaking their backs  
But those Texas zoo no would ever get into a carriage  
Or anything that might lead to an interracial marriage

And don't even try to come with an excuse why!

We didn't notice where our enemy was really coming from!

Without saying a word you can light up the dark

What I hear when you don't say a thing  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud  
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd  
Old Mr. Webster could never define  
What's being said between your heart and mine

Rod Stewart,/r/rod+stewart/camouflage_20117205.html,Camouflage,"She came to the party  
In a leather number wrapped in chains  
Investigation found  
She was very fond of dropping names  
So I signed her book  
And drove her to her home  
And she looked so hot  
Started to come on strong  
Then she said so candidly  
As I was gettin' down on my knees  
""I don't really mean to tease  
But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy""  
Camouflage  
That's nothin' but camouflage  
  
He was totally handsome  
With a winning personality  
Natural born leader  
With connections in society  
But late at night  
Alone with just his wealth  
He would stare in the mirror  
And never see himself  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
He had a hit with every song  
Sounded like something's wrong  
Why, why, why, why, why  
  
Camouflage  
It ain't nothin' but camouflage  
Camouflage  
Ain't nothing but, nothin' but  
Nothin' but camouflage  
  
They were so well suited  
With an ambiance you can't ignore  
But nobody realized  
What went on behind closed doors  
He had many affairs  
But never felt fulfilled  
She would hide her sadness  
In alcohol and pills  
She bottled everything up inside  
He was too busy with his best friend's wife  
They couldn't look each other in the eyes  
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage  
Just camouflage  
Everywhere you go it's called camouflage  
Some people hide behind camouflage  
  
see A-M-O you F-L-A-G-E  
  
I signed her book, drove her to her home  
But I didn't know what was goin' on  
  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
Had hits with every song  
  
He had many affairs but never felt fulfilled  
She was hidin' herself in some little purple pills  
  
Why, why, why, why  
Shy, shy, shy, shy  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Talkin' 'bout camouflage  
camouflage, bring it down  
  
Sometimes I worry about you darlin'  
You wear too much mascara  
Too much eyeliner  
Too much rouge, and it worries me  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Camouflage, talkin' 'bout camouflage

'Cos I did not know if I was in or out of the town

Down life's avenue  
Just to try to find a way to smile again  
While I was on my way  
I met a wise man who said  
That happiness you only find within  
I learned my lesson then  
  
So I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
I go sailing  
Be surprised what you can find  
I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
Take a chance on your mind  
Be surprised what you'll find

Who said go up and away  
Take the magic of a mystery tour  
But I felt so all alone  
Though I could almost touch the stars  
I started missing things I touched before  
The tour was such a bore  
  
So I go sailing

'Cause I'm a nature boy  
  
Locked up inside  
You can't tell me where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
Rocks and trees and physical culture  
Some days you hide  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
We got a life that's undiscovered  
  
We threw it all away  
Throw it all away  
Rolling every way  
It's irresponsible  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered  
  
I'm a little fish and you're the river  
Living in a boat that's underwater  
We can tip, tip, tip it over  
You can push, push, make it better now  
Wake your daddy up  
It's a quarter to five  
Our little boat  
Has lost it's rudder  
Dive to the bottom  
And we never come up  
  
A polka party  
For Bob and Martha  
I'm absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
'Cause I'm a nature boy  
Think what you like  
This is really where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
We don't need clothes and we don't need money  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered

Taylor Swift,/t/taylor+swift/a+perfectly+good+heart_20658058.html,A Perfectly Good Heart,"[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall  
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall  
No matter what you say I still can't believe  
That you would walk away  
It don't make sense to me but  
  
[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
It's not unbroken anymore  
How do I get it back the way it was before  
  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Taylor Swift,/t/taylor+swift/come+back+be+here_21051327.html,Come Back... Be Here,"You said it in a simple way,  
4 AM, the second day,  
How strange that I don't know you at all.  
Stumbled through the long goodbye,  
One last kiss, then catch your flight,  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself don't get attached,  
But in my mind I play it back,  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
The delicate beginning rush,  
The feeling you can know so much,  
Without knowing anything at all.  
And now that I can put this down,  
If I had known what I know now,  
I never would have played so nonchalant.  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets,  
That never bring you back to me,  
I can't help but wish you took me with you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in London today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,  
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.  
  
New York, be here.  
But you're in London and I break down,  
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.  
  
This is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
I don't wanna miss you like this.  
Come back, be here.

So those are my dreams  
and these are my eyes.  
Stand tall like a man.  
Headstrong like a horse.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of secrets.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb.  
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else,  
could show you something new about you and your inner song.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Break it down again.  
So those are my schemes  
and these are my plans.  
Hot tips for the boys.  
Fresh news from the force.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of silence.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
""No sleep for the dreaming"" say the architects fo life.  
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice?  
They make no mention of the beauty of decay.  
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Horsing around.  
Pray to the power.  
Play to the crowd  
with your big hit sound.  
And they won't simmer,  
won't simmer,  
won't simmer down.  
Play to the crowd.  
Play to the crowd.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
Last off to heaven just like moses on a motorbike.  
No revolution maybe someone else somewhere else.  
Could show you something new to help with the ups and downs.  
  
Break it down again.  
I want to break it down.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
  
No more sleepy dreaming.  
No more building up.  
It is time to dissolve.  
Break it down again.  
No more sleepy dreaming.

No matter, whatever, whenever  
We can never ever stay together

Just to bring, to bring me bread  
His body like a sculpture  
Almost decorated  
  
And I'll wake him  
As the dawn does  
And we'll break in  
On the bus  
Saying this was  
Made for us and love  
  
In lovers' communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break, bring me again  
In lovers' communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will we break, even break  
  
Step it up  
Grab your phone  
Get your suitcase  
There's no time to waste  
A big adventure awaits  
  
Sad news, France  
Suffered a late snow  
The blooms break through the ice  
In San Francisco  
A guitar man finally confessed  
He loved that actress  
Hearts touched by frost, we fought  
In the land of the midnight sun  
I lost myself  
I lost myself  
  
I walk 300 miles  
Just to bring, to bring him bread  
In love some gifts are simple  
Of those I am derated  
So I wake him as the dawn does  
And we'll face what any lovers must  
Blueness pales within a flame's lust  
  
In lovers' communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break, bring me again  
In lovers' communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break  
Even break  
Will we break, even break  
Break, even break  
Does love  
Don't we  
  
Make life even  
Break

Wilson Pickett,/w/wilson+pickett/stagger+lee_20313954.html,Stagger Lee,"The night was clear and the moon was yellow  
And the leaves came tumbling down  
  
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark  
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' in the dark  
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late  
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight  
  
Stagger Lee told Billy, ""I can't let you go with that""  
""You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat""  
Stagger Lee started off goin' down that railroad track  
He said ""I can't get you Billy but don't be here when I come back""  
  
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four  
Said ""I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe""  
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door  
He said ""Nobody move"" and he pulled his forty-four  
  
Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh he shot that poor boy so bad  
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass

But the vision is still the same  
Out of my mind  
But the memory remains unchanged  
Stones thrown in anger hold twice the hurt  
Return to sender could only make things worse

Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
'Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
.  
Don't ask me why  
Why I've lived with this all alone  
Locked up inside  
And it's cutting me to the bone  
Love is a stranger avoiding me  
Beware of danger's the only sign I see

Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart

Is there something that you'd like to say  
Am I getting through  
Are you just gonna leave me this way  
Yeah

Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Before it tears me in two  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
That's all I'm asking of you  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
'Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life

Take a broom and sweep one in  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy

I can't deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me one

By my window  
Take a net and fish one in

Or I'd miss the sight of all the honey strolling by

To sweep it all clean  
We need a beat boom  
We need a new scheme  
Break all the deadlocks  
And spill all the beer  
Mr Ditko was right  
Mr A so near  
Break out the paints and the brushes  
And spill out your hearts  
No amount of soft soap  
Can ever give you a fresh start  
We are walking on a tight rope  
We can slip beyond religion  
The answer's in your cranium  
And not on independent television
