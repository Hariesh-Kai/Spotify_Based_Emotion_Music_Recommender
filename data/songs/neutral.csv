ABBA,/a/abba/fernando+in+spanish_20930420.html,Fernando (In Spanish),"Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

ABBA,/a/abba/hole+in+your+soul_20002873.html,Hole In Your Soul,"You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul

ABBA,/a/abba/the+piper_20002946.html,The Piper,"They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon

ABBA,/a/abba/when+i+kissed+the+teacher_20002628.html,When I Kissed The Teacher,"Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher

All my life I've been a manual man  
I like the floor all the power in my hand  
Driving up and down the road all day  
Overtaking anything in the way  
Alongside us came a man in a grin  
Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game  
A different unit was ordered that day  
Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind  
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place  
Both saying with a smile on our face.

Now that the seasons show  
To tell me, love, your heart will soon mend  
  
We counted everyday  
Only to show we needed each other  
Who needs a reason to love  
When friends just seem to know  
They know it  
  
You have lots of dreams, I know  
Now it's the close of the show  
Let's hope it'll all passes by in the end  
So get yourself along

From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards

Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know

Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the run-way  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...

Andrea Bocelli,/a/andrea+bocelli/sogno_20007813.html,Sogno,"SOGNO  
  
Va ti aspettero'  
II fiore nel giardino segna il tempo  
Qui disegnero' il giomo poi del tuo ritorno  
Sei cosi sicura del mio amore  
Da portarlo via con te  
Chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando ancora a me  
E se ti servira' lo mostri al mondo  
Che non sa che vita see'e'  
Nel cuore che distratto sembra assente  
Non sa che vita see'e'  
In quello che soltanto il cuore sente  
Non sa  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Tempo che non basta a cancellare  
Coi ricordi il desiderio che  
Resta chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando a me  
E ti accompagnera' passando le citta' da me  
Da me che sono ancora qui  
E sogno cose che non so di te  
Dove sara' che strada fara' il tuo ritorno  
Sogno  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Sogno  
Un rumore il vento che mi sveglia  
E sei gia' qua

I'm having a lousy day  
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then  
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I don't really give a damn  
But I don't have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker

I open up my mail

Saying that I have only 20 hours to go  
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year  
So I run down to the bank but there's a 20-mile lineup

I took out 40 bucks  
From the automatic teller. It told me  
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10  
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup  
And I'm talking to the teller  
She says ""Wait I'll get your last month's statement""  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection  
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even  
Own a car

I met him at the candy store.  
He turned around and smiled at me.  
Ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
My folks were always puttin' him down.  
Down! Down!  
They said he came from the wrong side of town.  
They told me that he was bad,  
But I knew that he was sad.  
And that's why I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
One day my dad said, ""Find someone new.""  
New! New!  
I had to tell my Jimmy that,  
Whoa, we were through.  
He stood up and then he asked me why.  
But all I could do was cry.  
I'm sorry I hurt you,  
The leader of the pack.  
  
He sort of smiled and he kissed me goodbye.  
The tears were beginning to show.  
And as he drove away from me  
On that rainy, rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow.  
But whether he heard me  
I'll never, never, never, never know!  
Look out now, now, look out!  
Whoa oh no no no! Whoa no no no! No! No!  
  
I felt so helpless! What could I do-wo-wo-wo-wo?  
The only, only love that we had was through.  
At school they all stop and stare.  
I can't hide the tears.  
I just don't care!  
I will never forget you,  
The leader of the pack!  
Whoa-oo-woh! Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is, whoa gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!

Not a real one, just a dream  
A wonderful vision of us as a team  
Can you imagine how I feel now  
Love is real now, it's ideal  
You're just what I wanted  
And now it's nice to live  
Paradise to live  
  
I know why I've waited  
Know why I've been blue  
Prayed each night for someone  
Exactly like you  
  
Why should we spend money  
On a show or two  
No one does those love scenes  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I want to hand the world to you  
I hope you'll understand  
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'  
And dream I'm dreamin'  
  
Now I know why mother  
Taught me to be true  
She meant me for someone  
Exactly like you

There's a new gal in town.  
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt.  
All the guys just rave about  
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.  
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.  
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.  
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
  
All you gals will get the blues,  
All you pals will surely lose.  
And, there's but one excuse.  
Now I've told you who she was,  
And I've told you what she does,  
Still, give this gal her dues.  
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown  
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.  
Fellas, won'tcha tip your hats.  
Oh boy, ain't she the cats?  
Who's that mister, ain't her sister, it's Sweet Georgia Brown.

You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place

Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching his restless day  
  
He turns from his window to me  
Sad smile his apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
Still he spares me words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind  
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's a world you know  
There's a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To lock you safe behind it's open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see  
Now my kind words find their way back to me  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's world you know  
Got a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess it's two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times,

She starts laughing thinking about

Think I'm going down to the well tonight  
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will

And it starts to turn yellow  
Pedal to the floor  
'Cause I know your heart is turning red  
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours  
And make love to your mind and not your body instead  
I was just a fool, a fool for you  
That didn't know what I had until I lost you  
And every single moment that you're not here  
You said the evident to me that everything just seems so clear  
  
And I want it all back

Now to label your trousers and label your shoes  
If you don't wear nothing then label that too

Locked in overflow  
Sometimes I swear I could spin these old wheels  
Just let it go

Coming through the waves on the radio  
Or something that you see gently taps your memory  
And shoots you down  
Those hometown thoughts, school yard dreams and yesterdays  
Moving in I just put my head down and drift away  
And we're moving up and down, in and out of town  
We're all searching for that piece of higher ground somewhere

Me of you constantly  
Your name is whispered by the breeze and love birds  
Bring your song to me

In the sky your love will stay a flame in me  
A flame that burns so bright

'Cause she don't want anybody to see  
What she looks like when she's down  
'Cause that's a really sad place to be  
Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls  
Then she wonders why they beg her please to never call  
She says, ""I'm ok. It's alright. Hey, look who's on TV tonight.""  
She says, ""I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight.""  
  
Don't you wonder why it's dark outside at night?  
She says, I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight.

We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
A man is real  
Not made of steel  
  
But the earth is all we know  
We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
The beginning was the end  
Of everything now  
The ape regards his tail  
He's stuck on it  
Repeats until he fails  
Half a goon and half a god  
A man's not made of steel  
  
Twist away  
Now twist and shout  
The earth it moves too slow  
But the earth is all we know  
We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
A man is real that's how he feels

When the forces of corruption  
Do the tyrannize  
Then I shift to overdrive  
And start to pulverize

Go on and dump the dude  
  
You know that we've been friends for so many years  
And I've never ever seen you this way  
So torn apart, how he gets to your heart  
With all the little games that he plays  
Just give him up, get him out of your life  
Promise me that once and for all  
You're gonna tell him that it's over and done  
The very next time he calls, ain't you now  
  
Dump the dude

Girl, I know you may think this is none of my business  
But the fact that we're friends I believe that makes it my business  
I care about you but I ain't preachin'  
I think you should dump the dude  
  
I don't know why you'd want to settle for less  
When you could have so much more  
You know that you deserve only the best  
So what are you waiting for?

She's been there, God knows, she's been there  
She has seen and done it all  
She's a woman, she know how to  
Dish it out or take it all  
Her heart's as soft as feathers  
Still she weathers stormy skies  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors  
You can toss her around and round  
You can keep her in you vision  
But you'll never keep her down  
She's a lover, she's a mother  
She's a friend and she's a wife  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
Gentle as the sweet magnolia  
Strong as steel, her faith and pride  
She's an everlasting shoulder  
She's the leaning post of life  
She hurts deep and when she weeps  
She's just as fragile as a child  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
She's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
Oh, bless her, Lord  
She's an eagle when she flies

And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny  
Till I found there is a way of crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
Saw it late one night on a secret channel  
It's farther on along the tunnel  
It's way beyond the final station  
That's the one they never mention  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You don't have to pay them that much  
You had better bring your lunch  
It's undercover, around the houses  
Up your skirt and down your trousers  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
She said, ""I catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me  
Attach me to your credit card and then you can undress me

It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
And the murmuring waters sing the song  
The echoing mountains hum along  
The whispering valleys fill the air

It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon

There were many things I did not possess  
I never complained because my father said  
""son, you'll get your chance before you're my age.""  
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit  
Written all over his face  
  
He said, ""others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'.""

I had my fair share of neat women  
But they came between me and my suit  
That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston  
Not forgetting the one in Detroit  
They said, ""we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet  
But can't you lose your suit?""  
I said, ""no, you can't do that to me.""  
I remember what my father said  
  
He said, ""others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'.""  
Three button hand me down, ha, ha  
Three button hand me down  
  
I've never been a tidy dresser  
And the fold in my trousers - it ain't straight  
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one  
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit  
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor  
And get myself a smooth outfit  
Then I remember what my father said to me  
I'll make you from the open road  
  
He said, ""others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you go.""

Letting other people, strangers say our lines?  
To think it should come to this, after all these years  
What was mine and what should stay behind

We have said it once and said it all again  
This time we have gone too far, it could never be the same  
It's time to carry on create new lives  
Once we promised we would stay together forever

I ain't got a thing to show

So don't go foolin' around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
There's a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green

Gordon Lightfoot,/g/gordon+lightfoot/let+it+ride_20061571.html,Let It Ride,"These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you  
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true  
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun  
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride

What will the kitten do, mother, all alone  
Will he stop from his frolic for the day  
Will he lie on his rug by the side of my bed  
As he did before I went away  
  
What will Thomas, that old gardener, say  
When you ask him for flowers for me  
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care  
The first, fairest bloom of the tree  
  
I have seen the tears in his honest, old eyes  
But he said it was the wind that brought them there  
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day  
And his hand went trembling through my hair  
  
Keep tied, mother, my poor little dog  
For I know he will mourn for me too  
Just keep him when old and useless he grows  
Sleepin' the whole summer through  
  
Show him my coat, mother, so he'll not forget  
His master who then will be dead  
Just speak to him kindly and often of Joe  
And pat him on his brown, shaggy head  
  
And you, dearest mother, may miss me for a while  
But in Heaven I'll no larger grow  
And any kind angel will know at the gate

Do you have to pretend to be older than you are  
Beads and mirrors by your body  
And in some roadside bar you feel the pain  
Little star  
  
Lost on a merry go round, on the game  
You can never be found cause you don't know who you are  
The reservation killed your nation  
And in some tourists car you feel the pain

You know you know

We never slow  
We always win  
And you feel lost  
And you feel crossed  
And you feel tossed  
Just like the wind  
Your father will have told you of the wind  
  
Bowed those fine heads that, once proud, roamed the plains  
They sought nothing to gain 'til our fathers civilised  
And broken hearted arrows roamed the skies  
Then you were born to feel the pain  
Little star  
  
You know you know  
We grow and grow  
We never slow  
We always win  
And you feel lost

And how you've grown my little bird  
I'm regretting letting you fly  
  
6 pounds and 7 ounces, a ball of bones and flesh and tears were you  
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew

As he flies on the wings of a dream,

So:  
Come  
Get together  
Let the dance floor feel your leather  
Step as lightly as a feather  
Let yourself go  
Come  
Hit the timber  
Loosen up and start to limber  
Can't you hear that hot marimba?  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Relax  
And let yourself go  
Relax  
You've got yourself tied up in a knot

So  
Come  
Cuddle closer

The same in the rain and sun  
Two different faces, but in tight places  
We think and we act as one

Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can

Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show  
  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk

They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?  
  
There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so  
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on
opening nights  
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there
in lights  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's
no attack  
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show  
  
(There's no business like show business like no business I know)  
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there
you are  
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the
show!!

Terpisah dari ramai  
Berteman nyamuk nakal... Dan segumpal harapan  
Kapankah datang... Tuan berkantong tebal...  
  
Habis berpasang-pasang... Tuan belom datang  
Dalam hati resah menjadi bimbang  
Apakah esok hari... Anak anakku dapat makan...  
  
O Tuhan beri... Setetes rejeki...  
  
Dalam hati yang bimbang berdoa...  
Beri terang jalan anak hamba....  
Kabulkanlah... Tuhan...

Iwan Fals,/i/iwan+fals/sudrun_20583760.html,Sudrun,"Angin panas otak panas  
Orang waras jadi ganas  
Hawa gerah hidup susah  
Ngomongnya ngaco di anggap gila  
Rumah kontrakkan belum terbayar  
Uang habis utang numpuk  
Pemasukkan belum jelas  
Pengeluaran sudah jelas  
Ooh . . . . . . . . . . apakah ini  
Siapa yang tahu  
Tak ada yang tahu  
Seringkali kita terpaksa berfikir  
Melihat orang yang menjadi gila  
Sebab tak sanggup lagi menanggung  
Beban hidup yang semakin berat  
Nasib baik belum datang  
Angin surga sering datang  
Kepala pusing kepanasan  
Mau menangis tidak bisa

Walau s'patah kata tentu kudengar  
Tambah senyum sedikit apa sih susahnya  
Malah semakin manis semanis tebu  
Engkau tau isi hatiku  
Semuanya sudah aku katakan  
Ganti kamu jawab tanyaku  
Ya atau tidak itu saja  
Bila hanya diam aku tak tahu  
Batu juga diam, kau kan bukan batu  
Aku tak cinta pada batu  
Yang aku cinta hanya kamu  
Jawab nona dengan bibirmu  
Ya atau tidak itu saja  
Tak aku pungkiri aku suka wanita  
Sebab aku laki-laki masa suka pria  
Kau kuraslah isi dadaku  
Aku yakin ada kamu di situ  
Jangan diam bicaralah  
Ya atau tidak itu saja

Right here with me

One minute of one hour of one night  
You might be the center

You play the perfect part of  
Someone who's a part of me  
You'd help repeating  
The haunting of heart  
So perfectly

I can't stop questioning  
Oh God of love, peace, and mercy, why so much suffering?  
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me  
Wonder if you're listening...

Why don't you choose me?

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town

And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red  
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead  
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four  
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more  
One and nineteen more  
  
Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around  
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town  
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead  
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red  
After Texas Red  
  
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red  
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead  
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip  
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet  
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street  
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath  
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death  
About to meet his death  
  
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play  
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day  
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped  
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round  
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

There was a hermit named Fred  
Who kept the dead horse in his cave  
And everyone said to Fred  
""Fred, how come you keep a dead horse  
In your cave?"", and he said, ""Well""  
  
(Everybody loves a nut)  
(The whole world loves a weirdo)  
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut  
A Columbia man named Frank  
Had a tiger named Hank  
  
He tried to put Hank in his tank  
Guess what happened to ol' Frank  
When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs  
And erected a tombstone that read  
  
(Everybody loves a nut)  
Another Columbia fella told queen Isabella  
I don't think the world is flat  
And now what do you think about that  
  
And she said  
""You don't"", and he said, ""No mam""  
And she said  
""He'd get out of my queendom""  
And he said, ""Yes mam""

Josh Groban,/j/josh+groban/un+amore+per+sempre_10153954.html,Un Amore Per Sempre,"Ecco ora mai, il momento temuto da tempo, sai  
Gia so quello che mi dirai, e la fine di noi.  
  
So che con lui  
tu ti senti piu  
libera di essere  
di volere, di prendere  
di contare di piu  
  
Che sciocco io  
io che ti ho dato tutto di me  
Ora che vai  
stai portando il mio cuore con te.  
  
Un amore per sempre  
dura solo un istante  
Sono tanti ricordi che  
svaniscono in te  
Resta forse quel sogno  
Una storia di amanti  
ma a la fine vai via  
da me  
  
Questa citta' che mi penso  
deserto di lacrime  
Sento il cuore affogato in me  
Mentre tu sei con lui  
  
Dicono che no si muore nel'amore  
Non perdi mai  
Io mi sento morire ormai  
fuoco dentro di me  
  
So pure che dovrei essere felice per te  
  
Ma, mentirei, perche volgio che resti con me  
  
Un amore per sempre  
Dura solo un istante  
Sono tanti ricordi  
che svaniscono in te  
  
Resta forse quel sogno  
una storia di amanti  
Ma la fine di verlo  
te ne vai, vai con duole  
  
Un amore per sempre  
dura solo un istante  
Sono troppi ricordi  
che svaniscono in te  
Resta quel che momento  
forse solo un istante  
Ma la fine vai via  
lontano da me

In the afternoon, the sun was getting low,  
And then the bushes shook, and out they came at me,  
They were robbing half naked, while they beat me head to toe,  
And they left me on the road to jericho.  
Lying almost slain, and wounded by the road,  
Crying out in pain for a sympathetic soul,  
First a priest, and another of my kind,  
Well they were men I could have trusted, but they left me deaf and blind,  
They were strangers on the road to jericho.  
Through the blood and tears, I saw a worried face,  
He was from samaria, my people hate his race,  
He bandaged up my wounds and laid me on his horse,  
Although my memory is cloudy, I still can feel his friendly flow,  
Such a kind man on the road to jericho.  
When I later asked the innkeeper the mans name he did not know,  
Just a neighbor on the road to jericho.

King Diamond,/k/king+diamond/follow+the+wolf_20078710.html,Follow The Wolf,"The morning slowly came, my life about to end  
Then the wind would change, all but one had left  
The angelic wolf had stayed, without a word she said  
Follow me, follow the wolf  
  
And so I followed the wolf, up the wooded mountain side  
Close to the top... she suddenly stopped  
Sun to the East, man and beast  
Just two silhouettes... in a landscape never to forget  
  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the village beneath  
A few and distant roads all leading away from here  
Nobody in the streets... decay  
I must follow the wolf again, I must follow her till the end  
  
The end  
The Wolf had turned around, facing higher ground  
And there it was... The House of God  
In awe I looked as time had stopped  
  
Follow me  
I had never seen a church like this before  
""This Place is terrible"" inscribed above the door  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within  
  
A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin  
Nobody in the church... decay  
Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night  
I wonder if God was ever here  
Or did he turn away in fear, did he turn away in fear?

7 figures walk the streets of Louviers  
Picard is one, another two are priests  
And then the nuns going to  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again  
  
The room is dark  
Candies on the wall, they've been here before  
The christian cross is hanging high above  
The altar of GOD  
  
Madeleine is at the gate  
Hazy feeling in her brain  
As the strangers come in to  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again  
  
The strangers brought  
The sweetest little child, but something's wrong  
The baby cries, someone here will die  
And now the nuns pray  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy, again and again  
  
Madeleine and the other nuns  
They hold the infant up to the cross  
As father Picard and the priests  
Approach with hammers and nails  
There's no more to tell

Standing underneath the light show,  
Illuminated by the artificial light.

I couldn't tell if she was black or white,  
It didn't matter in the artificial light,  
Artificial light.  
Artificial light.  
Artificial light.  
Artificial light.  
  
First time I saw her she was easy to know,  
She had nothing to hide, she put it all out to show.  
She didn't cover up or try to conceal,  
I knew the way that she felt 'cause her expression was real.  
She didn't cover up the inside,  
She showed it all on the outside,  
Stark naked in the artificial light.  
  
Everybody gotta learn to relax,  
To be yourself you have to put on an act.  
Get together in the artificial light.  
  
And if I saw her in the light of day,  
I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know what had happened.  
I only want to know a world below,  
Where we can be ourselves beneath an artificial glow.  
  
And if you're scared what your friend'll say,  
And you're embarrassed by the light of day,  
Get together in the artificial light.  
  
Everybody let yourself go,  
Everybody to a floor show,  
Get together in the artificial light.  
Artificial light,  
Artificial light,  
Artificial light,  
Artificial light.

How can things go wrong  
When you're here with me  
All of time and space would stop  
They'd stop for you and me  
How can we go wrong  
We're like words within a song  
Perfect rhyme and perfect time  
And perfect harmony  
Now our words have lost their way  
And all they seem to say  
You don't intend to stay with me  
Tell me why  
When we have come this far  
We're happy as we are  
But now  
How can I feel right  
When you're not by my side  
Strange that I'm here all alone  
As I recall the happy times  
The happy songs, the perfect rhymes  
How can I go on  
How can I move on  
How can I, how can I  
Without you  
Now our words have lost their way  
And all they seem to say  
You don't intend to stay with me  
Tell me why  
When we have come this far  
We're happy as we are  
But now, now  
How can I feel right  
When you're not by my side  
Strange that I'm here all alone  
As I recall the happy times  
The happy songs, the perfect rhymes  
How can I go on  
How can I move on  
How can I, how can I, how can I

I will never pass for a perfect bride,  
Or a perfect daughter.  
Can it be, I'm not meant to play this part.  
Now I see,  
That if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight, back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I don't know  
Somehow I cannot hide, who I am  
Though I've tried.  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.  
  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.

When is the final curtain ?  
What can I do to set me free ?

Never know which way to go  
It might end up wrong  
So you better be strong  
  
Too many games we have to play  
They always change the rules  
You and me just trying to get along  
What can I do ?  
Got to be strong  
  
She walked into my daydream  
She told me how it had to be

My father was a dresser of hair  
My mother was a girl you could call on  
When you called she was always there [Repeat: x5]  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
It will only drive you insane  
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
  
I've looked behind all of the faces  
That smile you down to you knees  
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us  
And when you try to they make you say Please  
  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
  
Here come's your bride with her veil on  
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare  
Approach her, you ape with your tail on  
Once you have her she'll always be there  
  
Once you have her she'll always be there [Repeat: x4]  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
  
So I work in that same beauty salon  
I'm chained to the old masquerade  
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone  
I follow my father's trade  
  
I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
It will only drive you insane  
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown  
You can't melt it down in the rain [Repeats]

Ain't nothing go over the devil's back  
That don't buckle under his chin

And everybody's got Joe on the pan  
Somebody done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man  
  
Somebody done cooked up some stuff in a pot,  
Not too cold and not to hot  
They dropped a few drops in Joe's beef stew  
Now he's blowing his top, he don't know what to do  
  
They don't know who did it  
They can't find out  
But he's done hoodoo'd his last hoodoo without a doubt  
  
Somebody done hoodoo'd  
Done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man

It is not the 4th of July  
But we're celebrating Mr bb and Mrs bb have decided to call it a day  
After so many years, living together  
They have called us here today  
To witness what they call freedom from each other  
They've been living in style, they wanna end it in style  
They wanna end it with a bang.  
  
Chorus  
Divorce party, divorce party  
  
We see them now  
In the middle of the room  
Holding glasses so high  
They not renewing their sacred vows, not at all  
But they're telling everybody  
What they didn't like about each other  
One says, do you remember that day I said that  
Do you remember that day (x2) you did that  
I hope our paths will never meet again

I don't want to leave  
Cos you, were all, there was to know  
About me  
  
Somewhere  
On this crazy island  
A familiar stranger  
Sleeps so far away  
Wonder in the eyes of children  
And the smile of fortune  
Helps the memory fade  
Cos they are all there is to know  
About me  
  
Who are you now

Why we come, why we go.  
So why then do I know  
I will see you,

The heart knows why I grieve  
And yes one day I will close my eyes forever  
But I will see you  
I will see you in far off places.  
  
It's so easy for us to sit together  
But it's so hard for our hearts to combine  
And why?  
And why?  
Why? Why? Why? Why?  
  
Destiny for some is to save lives  
But destiny for some is to end lives  
But there is no end  
And I will see you in far off places.  
  
If your god bestows protection upon you  
And if the USA doesn't bomb you  
I believe I will see you somewhere safe  
Looking to the camera, messing around  
And pulling faces.

They'll never take us down  
  
Tho some may try  
We're gonna stand our ground

Can't be denied  
And they can never take us down oh no

Got freedom to believe  
And live the way we choose  
Ain't that's what freedoms all about  
It's something we can't never lose  
And if we go astray  
Let freedom be the light  
That takes us through the darkest night

That keeps us warm  
It burns inside.

But someone's watching over us  
And we believe in God we trust  
But if we hold on strong  
We'll make it through the night  
And walk in freedom's shining light

We'll get through this,  
We've been through worse  
  
They'll never take us down

Our freedom don't come free  
But it's worth the price we paid  
The dream inside us all  
It can not be denied  
Together let us raise our freedom's flag  
And let it fly  
  
Never take us down

Our road together's made  
Of tears and pride  
We know they can never take us down

Smiled at your funny little ways  
  
We watched our friends grow up together  
And we saw them as they fell  
Some of them fell into heaven  
And some of them fell into hell  
  
I took shelter from a shower  
And I stepped into your arms  
On a rainy night in Soho  
The wind was whistling all it's charms  
  
I sang you all my sorrows  
And you told me all your joys  
Whatever happened to that old song  
To all those little girls and boys  
Those little girls and boys  
  
Now the song is nearly over  
We may never find out what it means  
But there's a light I hold before me  
And you're the measure of my dreams  
The measure of my dreams  
  
These last two verses are not sung by Nick, but are part of the original song
as written by Shane Macgowan:  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the morning  
The gingerlady by my bed  
Covered in a cloak of silence  
I hear you in my head  
  
I'm not singing for the future  
I'm not dreaming of the past  
I'm not talking of the fist time  
I never think about the last  
  
Now the song is nearly over  
We may never find out what it means  
Still there's a light I hold before me  
You're the measure of my dreams  
The measure of my dreams

Nick Cave,/n/nick+cave/the+lyre+of+orpheus_20483116.html,The Lyre Of Orpheus,"Orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed  
Wondering what to do  
With a lump of wood, a piece of wire  
And a little pot of glue  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He sawed at the wood with half a heart  
And glued it top to bottom  
He strung a wire in between  
He was feeling something rotten  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus looked at his instrument  
And he gave the wire a pluck  
He heard a sound so beautiful  
He gasped and said O my God  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He rushed inside to tell his wife  
He went racing down the halls  
Eurydice was still asleep in bed  
Like a sack of cannonballs  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Look what I've made, cried Orpheus  
And he plucked a gentle note  
Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets  
And her tongue burst through her throat  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
O God, what have I done, he said  
As her blood pooled in the sheets  
But in his heart he felt a bliss  
With which nothing could compete  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus went leaping through the fields  
Strumming as hard as he did please  
Birdies detonated in the sky  
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled  
He hit a G minor 7  
He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep  
God was a major player in heaven  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
God picked up a giant hammer  
And He threw it with an thunderous yell  
It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head  
And knocked him down a well  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
The well went down very deep  
Very deep went down the well  
The well went down so very deep  
Well, the well went down to hell  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start  
All amongst the rotting dead  
His lyre tacked safe under his arm  
His brains all down his head  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood  
And she said to Orpheus  
If you play that fucking thing down here  
I'll stick it up your orifice!  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus  
It's enough to send you bats  
Let's stay down here, Eurydice, dear  
And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time  
He was on a real low down bummer  
And stared deep into the abyss and said  
This one is for Mamma  
  
O Mamma O Mamma  
O Mamma O Mamma

Now that you've gone away  
  
Leaving flowers on your grave  
Show that I still care  
But black roses and Hail Mary's  
Can't bring back what's taken from me  
I reach to the sky  
And call out your name  
And if I could trade  
I would  
  
And it feels  
And it feels like  
Heaven's so far away  
And it stings  
Yeah it stings now  
The world is so cold  
Now that you've gone away

By Saturday I learned a thing or two  
Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy  
Of whut the modern world was comin' to!  
  
I counted twenty gas buggies goin' by their sels  
Almost every time I took a walk  
Then I put my ear to a bell telephone  
And a strange woman started in to talk  
  
To you?  
  
What next?  
  
Yeah what?  
  
What next?  
Gather round!  
  
Everythin's up to date in Kansas City  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high  
About as high as a buildin' oughta grow  
Everythin's like a dream in Kansas City  
It's better than a magic lantren show  
You can turn the radiator on  
Whenever you want some heat  
With every kind of comfort  
Every house is all complete  
You can walk to privies in the rain  
And never wet your feet!  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
  
Yes sir!  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
  
Everythin's up to date in Kansas City  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque  
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show  
  
Gals?  
  
One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty  
As round above as she was round below  
I could swear that she was padded  
From her shoulder to her heel  
But latter in the second act  
When she began to peel  
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!  
She went about as fur as she can go  
  
Yes sir!

Patti Smith,/p/patti+smith/the+wicked+messenger_20105237.html,Wicked Messenger,"There was a wicked messenger, from Eli he did come  
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter  
When questioned who had sent for him, he answered with his thumb  
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter  
  
He stayed behind the assembly hall, it was there he made his bed  
Oftentimes he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read  
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning""  
  
Oh, the leaves began to fallin' and the seas began to part  
And the people that confronted him were many  
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart  
""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any""

Has he someone waiting there? or is he living on his own?

He waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter  
After spending half his life searching he still felt as blank  
As the ceiling at which he stared  
He is alive but feels absolutely nothing  
So is he?  
When he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him  
By nine he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact  
No tradebacks...  
So this is what it's like to be an adult  
If he only knew now what he knew then...  
I'm open... (2x)  
Come on in... (4x)  
I'm open... (2x)  
Come on in... (4x)  
I'm open...  
Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets and no covers he decides to  
Dream...  
Dream up a new self for himself...

An old drunk sings  
A young girl hocks her wedding ring  
Down on Rain Street  
  
Down the alley the icewagon flew  
Picked up a stiff that was turning blue  
The local kids were sniffin' glue  
Not much else for a kid to do  
Down Rain Street  
  
Father McGreer buys an ice cold beer  
And a short for Father Loyola  
Father Joe's got the clap again  
He's drinking Coca-Cola  
Down on Rain Street  
  
Bless me Father I have sinned  
I got pissed and I got pinned  
And God can't help the shape I'm in  
Down on Rain Street  
  
There's a Tesco on the sacred ground  
Where I pulled her knickers down  
While Judas took his measly price  
And St Anthony gazed in awe at Christ  
Down on Rain Street  
  
I gave my love a goodnight kiss  
I tried to take a late night piss  
But the toiled moved so again I missed  
Down Rain Street  
  
I sat on the floor and watched TV  
Thanking Christ for the BBC  
A stupid fucking place to be  
Down Rain Street  
  
I took my Eileen by the hand  
Walk with me was her command  
I dreamt we were walking on the strand  
Down Rain Street  
  
That night Rain Street went on for miles  
That night on Rain Street somebody smiled

On a mountain, in a rainstorm  
In the eyes of a mother with her newborn  
In the back pew, at the altar  
At the well where You gave the woman water  
In the chaos, in the holy  
In the darkness, anywhere a heart beats  
Anywhere a heart beats

Oh 'cause I need this hole gone  
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving  
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is
caving  
  
Not really sure how to feel about it  
Something in the way you move  
Makes me feel like I can't live without you  
It takes me all the way  
I want you to stay, stay  
I want you to stay, oh

It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights.  
Wed hide from the light on the village green when I was seventeen.  
When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year.  
It was a very good year for city  
Girls who lived up the stairs  
With perfume hair that came undone  
When I was twenty-one.  
  
When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year.  
It was a very good year for blue-blooded  
Girls of independent means.  
Wed ride in limousines. their chauffeurs  
Would drive when I was thirty-five.  
  
But now the days are short, Im in the  
Autumn of the year  
And now I think of my life as vintage  
Wine from fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs. it poured  
Sweet and clear. it was a very good year.

Here comes a big shot from the city

'Fill her up son, unleaded

See those tail lights heading west

Got no prospects, no education

That old cash box on the top shelf

I can sort it out later on the phone  
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight  
I'm gonna fill her up and head west  
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights  
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home  
And as I head through the woods on the way back  
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty  
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven  
And there's music playing  
This money is cold in my hand  
And a voice somewhere is saying  
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing  
And what real happiness can it bring?'

You're gonna fill her up with shame  
You're gonna fill her up with sorrow  
Before she even takes your name  
You're gonna fill her up with madness  
You're gonna fill her up with blame  
You're gonna live with no tomorrow  
You're gonna fill her up with pain  
You're gonna fill her up with darkness  
You're gonna fill her up with night

You gotta fill her up with light  
You gotta fill her up with spirit  
You gotta fill her up with grace  
You gotta fill her up with heaven

You gotta fill her up the right way  
You gotta fill her up with care  
You gotta fill her up with babies  
You gotta fill her up and swear  
You're gonna love that girl forever  
You're gonna fill her up for life  
You're gonna be a loving husband  
She's gonna be your loving wife

Lead Vocals by James Young  
  
In the dark so all alone  
Slowly reach for the telephone  
A message waits just for you  
A secret place, another rendezvous  
  
It's not always honesty  
That is the best policy  
But little lies can give you away  
Though you'll deny it if they say maybe you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
The other side of the Berlin Wall is  
Not far enough to avoid the call  
Somebody knows, somebody's seen  
Somebody knows right where you've been  
And that you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
Nowhere to hide, though we both might try  
I'm schizophrenic, and so am I  
Double life, a double life, a masquerade  
You know we all live a masquerade  
I know you're out there!  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?

How many times must I, lose you  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart breakin' down  
Or losing ground  
  
How many bridges must I burn  
How many lessons must I learn  
How many times must I ask you to stay  
How many times will you push me out of your way  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart breaking down, losing ground  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart losing ground, slowing down  
  
Maybe somebody will show me, a better way  
Maybe somebody will know me, someday  
How many times must I, hear your voice  
Inside my dreams, your answering machine  
You're always there and everywhere in between  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart slowing down  
Can ya hear the sound  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart leaving town, breakin' down  
Slowin' down, losin' ground, breakin' down and stopping here  
  
All I hear now  
All I hear now

They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away.  
We was sittin' ducks for the police man.  
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can.  
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway, wanted dead or alive,  
Dead or alive.  
Broken down and dirty, dressed in rags  
A from the day my mama told me, ""Boy, you pack your bags.""  
Send the mayor down in his pickup truck.  
The jury look at me, say, ""Outta luck.""  
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway, wanted dead or alive,  
Dead or alive.  
Now, I'm broken down and dirty, dressed in rags  
A from the day my mama told me, ""Boy, you pack your bags.""  
We was sittin' ducks for the police man.  
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can.  
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway, wanted dead or alive,

And you change me up and you turned it around  
In the wind and rain I'm gonna see you again  
In the morning sun and when the day is done  
And you take my hand and you walk with me  
Sometimes it feels like eternity  
And I turn the tide I get back my pride  
And I make you proud won't you say it out loud  
When I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground

And I show you like it has to be  
And you understand how the work is done  
And I pick up the sack in the midday sun  
And I pull you through by the skin of your teeth  
And I lift the veil, I see what's underneath  
And you return to me and you sit on your throne  
And you make me feel that I'm not alone  
  
And I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground  
  
Hey man, what's that you're carrying?  
  
Feels like lead  
  
It weighs a ton, let's see if we can dump it by the side of the hill  
  
Hey wait up, why don't you dump it on the burning ground  
  
Dump it down there  
  
Yeh man, dump the Jute  
  
Hey man dump the Jute on the burning ground  
  
Dump the Jute?  
  
Yeh you know, dump the Jute  
  
Dump the Jute!  
  
On the burning ground  
On the burning ground  
And you make me think what it's all about  
Sometimes I know gonna work it out  
And I watch you run in the crimson sun  
Tear my shirt apart open up my heart  
And I watch you run  
Down on your bended knees  
By the burnt out well  
Can you tell me please  
Between heaven and hell  
Won't you take me down  
  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
  
And you fall and pray, when you hear that sound  
As we're walking back to the burial mound  
And you shake your head and you turn it around  
And you see the flames from the burning ground  
And you get down on your knees and pray  
And I catch my breath as we're running away  
And I take the Jute and I throw him down  
  
On the burning ground, on the burning ground  
On the burning ground, it's on the burning ground.

Everyday after school she'd head don't to the tracks  
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust  
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust  
No one believed her when she said she heard the train  
Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Jenny laid a penny on the track one day  
In God we trust she walked away  
The very next mornin' all that she could find  
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime  
  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains

School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time  
School daze, school daze, I'm attending hell high  
  
A blackboard jungle toed the line the rulers made  
A homework hell-house screams at me ""make the grade!""  
Tick tock, three o'clock, I'm sitting here and counting off the days  
A fire bell is ringin' hell and I'd sure love to see it blaze  
Burn it down!

I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
They're gonna drive me crazy yet  
Nobody here is understanding me  
I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
They're gonna drive me crazy yet  
I'm dying here and trying to get free

Keep my secret well  
See how deep I fell  
Keep my secret well  
And I won't ask you for more  
Keep my secret well  
Like my veins keep my blood  
No wounds can be as deep  
As the love that I had

About all the women he had known and living life too fast  
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head

To the television's filth and sexual innuendo.  
Repressed.  
Our forefathers established this nation,  
Under the grace of God.  
  
In all his provisions.  
Why we are so richly blessed.  
Our Father,  
Deliver us

I lost my best friend last week at school  
He got shot  
Someone thought that he was part of something that  
He was not  
Now I'm watching all the cheerleaders show just how sad they are  
When my friend used to come 'round  
They used to laugh and egg his car  
Now I'm gonna do my part as a concerned citizen  
I think we should burn the school down  
And start again  
Burn it  
'Till there's nothing left

Where are all the friends who used to talk to me  
All they ever told me was good news  
People that I've never seen are kind to me  
Is it any wonder I'm confused  
  
When I break down  
When I break down  
  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take them all away  
  
Where are all of my friends  
My so called friends  
Take the wall away  
Take them all away  
Will somebody here me?

Don't let it show, don't let it show

Just let it go, just let it go  
  
And if it hurts when they mention my name  
Say you don't know me  
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame  
Say you don't own me  
  
Even if it's taking the easy way out  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in, don't tell them anything  
Don't let it,  
Don't let it show  
  
Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say  
Say you don't care, say you don't care  
Even if you want to believe there's a way  
I won't be there, I won't be there  
  
But if you smile when they mention my name  
They'll never know you  
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame  
They'll never own you

But I would rather be  
Both feet on the ground  
What if the engine dies  
These are no friendly skies'

It's all a twist of fate  
But it's myself I hate

The more you take the less for me  
Money don't buy what you really need  
It make an iceman cry, a stoneman bleed

It rules your life like a virgin queen  
One day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It rules the world like a green machine  
  
In the bank, in a box, money talks  
In the black, on the rocks, money talks, money talks  
  
Money don't lose in the money game  
It drags you down like a ball and chain  
So money don't come with a guarantee  
It make a fool of you, it make a fool of me  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you say  
It ties you down but it can set you free  
Some day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It burns you up in the first degree  
  
Moscow, Bangkok, money talk  
Park Lane, Boardwalk, money talk  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you try  
You deal the cards, give the wheel a spin  
One day you might get over it but everybody knows  
It's heads you lose and it's tails they win  
Don't have too much to show for it, that's the way it goes  
You roll the dice and they cash you in

And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo  
  
Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, ""You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!"" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""  
  
The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy  
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
(Oh, you sing it with me,)

light  
But my friend is sitting on the edge of the day, turns from the evening into
night  
  
But everybody says he took a stage on him and everybody says I'm just a kid  
Faith in the tunnel took the places on him  
Well looky-looky-looky, well my fingers are ditty-ditty-ditty  
Wop-bop-bop-a-lup-bop-a-lop-bam-boom  
  
Well I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me  
I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me, that's right now...  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody hears, nobody sees  
Nobody's spoken to me, nobody cares, knows but me...

Wasn't this supposed to be a musical?  
Here I am  
In the balcony,  
How the hell could I have missed the overture?  
  
I like the scenery  
Even though, I have absolutely no, idea at all,  
What is being said, despite the dialogue,  
There's the leading man  
  
The movie star who never faced an audience  
Where's the orchestra?  
After all, this is my big night on the town  
My introduction to the theatre crowd  
  
I assumed that the show would have a song  
So I was wrong  
At least I understand  
All the innuendo and the irony  
  
And I appreciate,  
The roles the actors played  
The point the author made  
And after the closing lines,  
  
And after the curtain calls,  
The curtain falls  
On empty chairs,  
Where's the orchestra?

And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace

Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""  
""The madam has the cutest personality""

What was it made her the toast of Paree?  
She had a well-developed personality  
  
What did Romeo see in Juliet?  
Or Figaro in Figarette?  
Or Jupiter in Juno?  
You know!  
  
And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced  
No doubt it must have been easy to see  
That she knew how to use her personality  
  
A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well  
And never sit on the boss's left knee  
Unless she's got a perfect personality  
  
A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair  
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee  
If she can show a faultless personality  
  
Why are certain girls offered certain things  
Like sable coats and wedding rings?  
By men who wear their spats right?  
(That's right!)  
  
So don'tcha say ""I'm smart and have the kindest heart""  
Or ""what a wonderful sister I'd be""  
Just tell me how you like my  
""Rufff!

You're mine and I'm yours for the taking  
Right now the rules we made  
Are meant for breaking  
  
What you get ain't always  
What you see  
But satisfaction's guaranteed  
They say what you give is always  
What you need  
So if you want me to  
Lay my hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay you hands on me  
  
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet  
I'm a preacher  
I've been to school and  
Baby, I've been the teacher  
If you show me how to get  
Up off the ground  
I can show you  
How to fly and never  
Ever come back down  
  
Everything you want  
Is what I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
But the ride don't never ever  
Come for free  
If you want me to lay  
My hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay your hands on me  
  
Don't you know I only aim to please

These people meddling in our affairs  
They're not our friends  
Let's keep it between us  
Before the whole door closes  
And it comes to an end  
They'll tell you one thing, me another  
Till we don't know who to trust  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
Let's keep it between us  
We've been through too much together  
That they'll never share  
They've had nothing to say to us before  
Now all of a sudden it's as if  
They've always cared  
All we need is honesty  
A little humility and trust  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
I know we're not perfect, then again, so what?  
That ain't no reason to treat you like a snake  
Or to treat me like a slut  
And it's makin' me so angry  
Could we just lay back for a moment  
Before we wake up and find ourselves  
In a game that we both have lost?  
These easy cures and easy handsomes  
Somethin' tells me we can't afford the cost  
'Cause some things not fit for human ears  
Some things don't need to be discussed  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
They'll tell you one thing, me another  
Till we don't know who to trust  
Ohh, darlin', let's keep it between us  
Let's keep it between us  
Before the whole thing breaks down  
And goes too far  
If we can't settle our differences by ourselves  
Then we must be worse off  
Than they think we are  
Back seat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel  
But they sure know how to make a fuss  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
Can we keep it between us?

Indeed I could volunteer  
As the friend that you would want right near  
More like Rabbit and Pooh and Eeyore  
  
I'd be useful and helpful  
The one you would call  
Can I walk around my shadow  
Once before it disappears into the sun  
Run circles around the bees  
Bring the heffalump to his knees  
Catch the pollen before the sneeze  
I'd be needed and useful  
More each passing day

But in the biggest, helpfulest way

""I met him at the candy store  
He turned around and smiled at me  
You get the picture  
""Yes, we see""  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
My folks were always putting him down  
They said he came from the wrong side of town  
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad  
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
One day my dad said find someone new  
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through  
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry  
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack  
  
Do do  
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye  
The tears were beginning to show  
As he drove away on that rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,  
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!  
  
I felt so helpless, what could I do  
Remembering all the things we'd been through?  
In school they all stop and stare  
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care  
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack  
  
Ooh, the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone

Where little children laughed as they sang  
A happy song  
In the little town of Ceylon,  
Ceylon city, Ceylon city  
  
I've got a boat , i hope it's still afloat  
With rusty sails, and an old wooden oar  
It goes along, in the little town of Ceylon

My daddy will be waiting there  
My sister will be combing down her silver hair  
My mama will be waiting there  
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere

She can feel you  
Drifting far away  
But she can't see through  
What you do not say  
Take a step back  
Don't lose your ground  
Remember how you felt before  
And if you care about her  
Show her that you're sure  
  
If I were you  
My prized possessions  
Would be the ones I'd hold so close  
'Cause when you lose your love  
You lose what means the most  
If I were you  
I'd hold affection  
  
Higher than any star in sight  
Take this to heart  
And you'll never part  
These are the things that I would do  
If I were you  
  
Simple pleasures  
The hardest to be found  
Can't be measured  
'Till they're not around  
Maybe she'll go  
Maybe she'll stay  
But she'd rather go than fade away  
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow  
Is the saddest fate  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Take a step back  
Don't lose your ground  
Remember how you felt before  
And if you care about her  
Show her that you're sure  
  
If I were you  
I'd hold affection  
Higher than any star in sight  
Take this to heart  
And you'll never part

Wondering if you'd found your peace of mind  
I guess you'd be proud to know your grandsons  
Never crossed that Mason Dixon line  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Daddy wore his Purple Heart so proudly  
Long before I turned into a man  
Buried with our flag across his casket  
I was still too young to understand  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Mama spent her last years in the garden  
While I took my turn behind a gun  
Lord I'd give my life to find the freedom lost within the old songs that you
sung  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again

Diana Ross,/d/diana+ross/lets+make+every+moment+count_20040184.html,Lets Make Every Moment Count,"The bittersweet sadness of time passing by  
Trying to hold back the years  
you try to reach out and touch yesterday  
But yesterday just disappears  
  
We've shared a lot of sadness  
We've shared a lot of pain  
Let's make good use of the time that remains  
  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's taste the richness of life to it's fullest amount  
Between me and you and all we've been through  
There are no problems that we can't surmount  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's make every moment count  
  
I still remember the day we first meet  
We both didn't have a care  
The years have flown, but we've both grown  
We're none of the worse for the wear  
  
We're only just beginning  
I'm still your lover and your friend  
And it's never too late to dream again  
  
You say we've seen the best of all our memories  
But if your heart and soul are in it  
We'll make a new one every minute

Dire Straits,/d/dire+straits/one+world_20040682.html,One World,"Can't find no sleeves for my records  
Can't get no laces for my shoes  
Can't get no fancy notes  
On my blue guitar  
  
Can't get no antidote for blues  
Can't find the reasons for your actions  
Or I don't much like the reasoning you use  
Somehow your motives are impure  
Or somehow I can't find the cure  
Can't find no antidote for blues  
  
They say it's mostly vanity  
That writes the plays we act  
They tell me that's what everybody knows  
There's no such thing as sanity  
And that's the sanest fact  
  
That's the way the story goes  
Can't get no remedy on my TV  
There's nothing but the same old news  
They can't find a way to be  
One world in harmony  
Can't get no antidote for blues

You're making it hard for me to be true

Seems like every place I go I see you there  
I can't keep my eyes off you  
I just stand and stare

I don't trust me around you

Not once have I been untrue  
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself wanting to  
  
I don't trust me around you

You can keep your Dixie  
There's no one down in Dixie  
Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem  
  
Harlem has those southern skies  
They're in my baby's smile  
I idolize my baby's eyes  
And classy up-town style  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem

Whose course is braver run  
Still we are, have always been

Though the mist in my eyes might suggest  
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose  
But if I started over I know I would choose  
  
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way  
That fought me and tought me that friends never say

Back through the years I go wondering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be  
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me

Walking the block

And you don't see me

With a five dollar bill

When I saw you on t.v.  
You were wearing a piece of me  
And it breaks my heart to look around  
And see the unimpressed  
Who can't believe the emperor is dressed  
  
Turn on my t.v.  
I want to check some action  
If you got no video  
Well then folks don't want to know  
But with you up there to light the way  
I can wear a smile as I survey  
The faces in the dark  
  
Waiting for you to hit one out of the park  
We notice every tiny little detail  
And every word we read we'll take to heart  
But we never really understand  
  
Until you realize  
There are no lies  
When you see that look in their eyes  
what are we gonna use to fill the empty spaces?  
  
When you see her in the crowd  
Will you make your mama proud?  
She can turn around and see the faces  
  
Looking at her son  
Climbing his way up to number one  
Scratching his way up to number one

She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on  
  
She's a cowboy's buddy

Lord she's lovely from her front to back  
So either comin' or goin'  
Know her best side's showin'  
She's my cowboy Cadillac  
  
She's the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine

A real tough mother  
She's the cover of a magazine

She's my honkin' tonkin'  
Everything I'm wantin'

She loves to haul them cattle  
All my ropes and saddle  
And it doesn't matter work or play  
If it's a mountain she can crawl it  
If it's hay then she can haul it  
She's the last one to call it a day

Whatever he wanted he could get  
The badge on his waistcoat shone in the sun  
It ain't no lie, Big Jim was feared by everyone  
  
In the saloon one evening Big took a bet  
With a rancher whose name I forget  
He wanted a herd taken over the plain  
And he called Jim ""yellow"", he'll never do that again  
  
He got mad!  
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out  
He's gonna give it a try, he left no doubt  
  
""Must be mad, must be mad""!  
The people wished him well, and good luck  
""Hell, I don't need it""! He laughed , got on  
His horse and rode away  
  
Over on the trail, Jim 'n' his crew of five  
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive  
The weather was hard, but so were the men  
Though I don't think even Jim'll try this trip again  
  
His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead  
But the trouble didn't start till the men were in bed  
A-whooping and a-hollering and flashing their knives  
Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe  
  
  
He was scared, Big Jim was scared  
Alive, they called him lucky, but not today  
Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men  
  
Big Jim, he still won't lie down  
For him the bet is still on  
Some say he rides there, cursing still  
Some say they've seen him

Was dangerous from the start

I wound up scrubbin' the floor and a peelin' spuds.

So sad they had to fade it

Grateful Dead,/g/grateful+dead/little+sadie_20246475.html,Little Sadie,"Went down last night to take a look around  
Met little Sadie and I blew her down, went right home, went to bed  
Forty-four colt smokes under my head  
And I began to think what a deed I'd done  
Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run, but a little too slow  
They overtook me in Jericho  
I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell  
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville  
Says ""Young man, your name's Brown,  
Remember the night you blew Sadie down?""  
Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee,  
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree  
First degree and the second degree  
Got any papers won't you read 'em to me.  
They took me downtown all dressed in black  
Put me on the train and sent me back  
Sent me back to the county jail, I had nobody to go for my bail  
The judge and the jury they took the stand  
The judge hold the paper in his right hand  
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,  
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes

Grateful Dead,/g/grateful+dead/masons+children_20062494.html,Mason's Children,"Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall  
All his children grew and grew, they ain't never grown so tall before  
They may never grow so tall again  
  
We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day  
Taught us all we ever knew, we ain't never known so much before  
We may never know so much again  
  
The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate  
Mason's children ran and flew, they ain't never run so fast before  
Swore they'd never show their face again  
Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he  
  
Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me  
Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright  
Mason's children cooked the stew and cleaned up when the feast was through  
Take me to the repo-man to pay back what is owed  
If he's in some other land write it off as stole

I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest  
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell  
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request  
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come
alive.  
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me home before I die.  
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street  
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs  
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang  
Can I hear it before you travel on.  
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.  
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me back home before I die

Hank Snow,/h/hank+snow/little+britches_20797313.html,Little Britches,"I don't know much on religion and I ain't never had no show  
But I got a middlin' tight grip sir on the handful of things that I know  
I don't pan out on the prophets good will and that sort of thing  
But I believe in God and the angels ever since one night last spring.  
  
I come into town with some turnips and my little Gabe came along  
No four year old in this country could beat him for purty and strong  
Pert and chipper and sassy and always ready to swear and fight  
And I learned him to chaw tobaccy just to keep his teeth milk white.  
  
The snow came down like a blanket as I passed by Taget's store  
I went in for a jug of molasses and I left the team at the door  
But they scared at somethin' and started and I heard one little squeal  
And lickety split over the prairie went team Little Britches and all.  
  
Yes lickety split over the prairie I was almost froze with skeer  
But we rousted up some torches and we searched from far and near  
At last we struck hosses and wagon snowed under a soft white mound  
Upsot dead beat but of little Gabe no hide nor hair could be found.  
  
And here all hope soured on me of findin' my little Gabe  
So I just flopped down on my marrow bones  
And crotched deep in the snow and prayed  
By this time the torches was played out and me and Israel Par  
Went off with some wood to a sheep fold that he said was somewhere thar.  
  
We found it at last in a little she'd where they shut up the lambs at night  
We looked in and seen them huddled there so warm and sleepy and white  
And there sot Little Britches and chirped as pert as ever you see  
I wants a chaw of tobaccy and that's what's the matter of me.  
  
How did he get there angels he could never have walked in that storm  
They just scooped down and toted him to where it was safe and warm  
And I think that savin a little child and fodging him to his own  
Is a dern sight better business than loafin' around the throne...

Close your eyes girllook inside girl  
Let the sound take you away

And so I wished that I could stay  
Before the thing could answer me  
Well, someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found

Pulling the machine down  
Coming to the low sound  
Feeling like a real man  
  
Racing  
Flashing from down under  
Flesh and blood and thunder  
Trembling wheel in cold hand  
  
Faster, much faster  
wot a human speed disaster  
Deeper, much deeper  
on through the void I cast'er  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator  
Of my intimate machine  
  
Turkey  
Near to devastation  
losing all my patience  
Cannot make this kit fly  
  
Danger  
Muscular contraction  
Out for satisfaction  
Mere intoxication  
  
Nightride, it's nightride now-  
try to catch my tail lights  
So sad, I'm so sad  
But you won't ever suck my steel bride  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator

Take a thousand pin-up girls to stepney to bombay  
Take me to fancy restaurants to be amongst the whole milay  
And all the blue-eyed gals of 6 foot 3  
Are gonna leave you broken down on your knees  
Cause in the golden locks and their fluttering lashes  
You say, ""I told you"", all day long  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Just when you thought it was safe to get it on  
Watch out for their teeth boys you never trust a blonde  
  
I been dreaming of clinches  
With scene stealing wenches  
And stars of hollywood and Vine  
Too many goofs and ham-fisted moves and blaming it on the wine  
Now your best bet's, a hung lovin' brunette  
Make it quick boys cause I ain't got long  
And turn your back on the girl in black  
You never trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Forget all that stuff about ad-men, like my own father  
My daddy said, ""rocky, don't even trust your mom""!

Sure as anight on the moon shine, a recipe for leaving me slaughtered  
So beware of the smell and the lies they all tell  
One line from a fair blues song  
I'm telling you mate, when the hour gets late  
You cannot trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
You think you can hide behind peroxide, then you got it wrong, so wrong  
Watch out for their teeth boys, never trust a blonde  
  
Here comes another, never trust a blonde  
She could be a mother, never trust a blonde  
Even in China, they never trust a blonde  
She minght be a blinder, never trust a blonde

Squeeze in another, never trust a blonde

And I've got work to do.

Come back here and shut the door

There is fire there is lust  
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust  
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails  
It's so simple the betrayal  
Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.  
  
Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Don't you recognize them anymore  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There's the given and the expected  
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected  
Is this for better is this for worse  
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.  
  
I hear the owl in the night  
I realize that some things never are made right  
By some will we string together here  
Days to months and months to years  
What if everything we have adds up to nothing.

Come timelessly dancing  
Through my dreams to me

Jackson Browne,/j/jackson+browne/the+word+justice_20068699.html,The Word Justice,"A man stands up before his God and country  
Raises his right hand and takes an oath  
Swears he has acted in the line of duty  
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth  
But there is a need to keep somethings a secret  
Some weapons shipments, some private wars  
In the future democracy will be defended  
Behind closed doors  
Now the men of Congress who convene to determine  
If covert war is a business or a crime  
Are the same men who routinely give their permission  
For the shedding of blood in security's name  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The names of some countries, the terms of some deals  
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent  
Beneath our wheels  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?  
In the streets of America the children are buried  
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs  
They live and they die in the bowels of a business  
That disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source  
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through  
I am waiting for the time to come  
When the word will be real for everyone  
And not just a word but a thing that can be done  
Justice must be won  
Oh, oh, oh justice

Oh, oh, oh justice

That fateful night, that night.  
When nothing she said could keep her man

Sometimes I'm almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
And sometimes I'm deep in despair  
  
On the road of experience, join in the living day  
If there's an answer, it's just that it's just that way  
  
When you're looking for space  
And to find out who you are  
When you're looking to try and reach the stars  
It's a sweet, sweet, sweet dream  
Sometimes I'm almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
But sometimes I'm deep in despair  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle,  
Like an eagle  
I go flying flying

I happened to see her... the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
  
You should've seen the way she wore her dress  
And her white stiletto shoes  
You should've seen the way they looked on her,  
Just like the ones that I bought you  
I searched for days on end to no avail 'til I found them in Peru  
She must've been to Lima just as well  
Because she had them too  
  
You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face  
She looked as sweet as honeydew  
You should've seen the way she walked away  
Oh, she swayed her hips like you  
  
I was only several steps from her but she never noticed me  
I took another sip of fine liqueur  
It was quite a sight to see  
  
I happened to notice the girl in the light shade of blue  
I happened to see her... the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you

Oh, you should've seen the way he stroked her hair,  
And the smile that lit her face  
You shoud've seen the way he kissed her lips  
Did it have the same sweet taste?  
  
Though my mind it might be running wild in constant search of you  
It's funny how my eyes keep seeing things, my heart would not believe are true

And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe  
There was leather and lace and every minority race  
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show  
Kristofferson got an offer for a movie  
Promoters closed another deal or two  
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter  
And he went home the minute he was through  
I moved with the mob at intermission  
To the green room where you see who you can see  
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's  
Paupers, punks and millionaires and me  
And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes  
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe

Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building  
In order for the beer truck to come through  
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie  
Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude  
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties  
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song  
There were women who once did and some who still would  
I heard one ask, ""Did Connie come along?""

If he gets a lotta loving  
If he has a lot of smiles

Tell about a life like his

Here's the way it is

Try to stay alive

Who's home every day at five  
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive  
Well, we shared a cup of coffee  
Then I had to warm it up  
And his greasy fingers trembled  
As he held onto the cup  
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music  
See a lot of sights  
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry  
Saturday night  
I will dedicate you a trucking song  
To which you can relate  
He said, you just do the singing  
And I'll do the driving mate  
All I do is drive, drive, drive  
Try to stay alive  
And keep my mind on my load  
Keep my eye upon the road

So I might as well begin  
To put some action in my life!

I can't even start  
I've had every promise broken  
There's anger in my heart

You don't have a clue  
If you did you'd find yourselves  
Doing the same thing too!

And I must admit they touched my heart  
I don't know where you borrow them  
But most of them are works of art  
  
No school boy with his Valentines  
Was ever more sincere  
I've tried to read between the lines  
To make the meaning clear  
  
But there's a little voice that whispers  
Softly, as I fall asleep:  
""You better look before you leap.""  
  
My intuition says to me,  
Don't ever give your heart away  
And so I simply must obey my intuition  
  
My intuition says to me  
Those pretty words may not be true  
So what am I supposed to do in my position?  
  
I'd like to trust my heart  
Believe in just my heart  
But it is much too young to know  
  
So though it may be bad advice  
I guess I'll have to string along  
Until you prove my intuition  
Can be wrong.  
  
My intuition goes like this:  
I'm playing poker with a bunch  
And all at once I get a hunch  
That's intuition  
  
I'm playing aces back to back  
And I can see a pair of kings  
But if there's one more of those things  
What's my position?  
  
Well, if you get the cards  
Then you should bet the cards  
At least, that's what I've always heard  
  
You have your hunch, I'll have mine  
Suppose we both we both just string along  
Until we prove our intuition can be wrong.

Everything that traffic will allow

Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold

The butcher, the baker, the grocer and the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause  
  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye  
For anything theatrical and why, why-y?  
  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
You get word before the show has started  
That your father died inside of dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted  
You're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far  
That night you open and there you are  
Next day on your dressing room  
They've hung a star

And he said how's dear old Ireland  
And how does she stand?

Waving its arm as the wind blows by  
And it looks so alive

Cause he knows that the souls of the lost,  
  
They can only be reached, through us,  
  
We're his hands and his feet.  
  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When god's children refuse to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.

Keith Urban,/k/keith+urban/country+comfort_10156436.html,Country Comfort,"Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
As the village children fight each other for their share  
And the six-o-nine goes roaring past the creek  
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week  
  
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four  
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn  
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's good old country comfort in my bones  
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known  
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Oh it's goin' back home  
  
Down at the well they've got a new machine  
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen  
""Hey but that ain't natural"" old Clay would say  
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Whoa, it's goin' back home  
Hey take me back home  
And a truck, and a truck that's goin' back home

Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid,  
So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,  
Making me think that you were, here again,  
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,  
That's the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,  
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,  
Right directions, but, never found it.  
  
Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Just the mere reflection of your face,  
For one shining moment  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
  
Called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,  
The drew chalk circles round, the place that we used to lay,  
But nobody testified, not a single witness,  
I swore I was crucified with, no forgiveness,  
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous,  
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,  
And in my blindspot, I saw the silhouette,  
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette,  
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,  
I'd fill up all this empty space,  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
Oh you, or somebody like you, oh  
  
Now I should of learned my lesson,  
Done what I was told,  
Should of counted all my blessings,  
Like fingers and toes,  
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,  
And searching high and low,  
For you, or somebody like you

And when he does his little rounds,  
'Round the boutiques of London Town,  
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at,  
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,  
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
There's one thing that he loves and that is flattery.  
One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he is in stripes.  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
They seek him here, they seek him there,  
In Regent Street and Leicester Square.  
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on,  
Each one an dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
His world is built 'round discotheques and parties.  
This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly.  
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be,  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.

It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
  
When I 1st met you, how you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow you just seem 2 drift away  
Then I discovered that you were cheating  
you were cheating on me  
But I was the last 2 know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
didn't I really love you, you know I gave you all my heart  
When I put my arms around you I never thought we'd ever part  
Then I discovered, I guess you couldn't love me  
Like you said you loved me, oh no  
Why was I the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
All of my life I was looking for someone just like you  
you shattered my dreams, tore me apart, what can I do?  
But I was the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody

You were the sensitive woman  
I was the very reverend Freud  
You were the manual orgasm  
I was the dirty little boy

By the ghost of you and me?  
  
Is this what you wanted...  
You were Marlon Brando  
I was Steve Mcqueen  
You were k.y. jelly  
I was vaseline  
You were the father of modern medicine  
I was Mr. Clean  
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon  
I was Rin Tin Tin  
  
And is this what you wanted...

You got old and wrinkled  
I stayed seventeen  
You lusted after so many  
I lay here with one  
You defied your solitude  
I came through alone  
You said you could never love me  
I undid your gown  
  
And is this what you wanted...

Delighting in your very company.

Don't you know it all the more enraptures me,  
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity.  
Green sleeves, you're all alone,  
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone.  
Green sleeves, there's no one home,  
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves  
  
I sang my songs, I told my lies,  
To lie between your matchless thighs.  
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild  
To finally end our exercise  
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn,  
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new.  
I reached for you but you were gone,  
So lady I'm going too.  
  
Green sleeves, you're all alone

The leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home.  
Green sleeves, it's so easily done,

I commission you, find a riff that's new  
Or your wig belongs to me.""

All you pals will surely lose.

C'mon baby let's kiss and make up  
Let's go steady again, like in the past  
Let's show all of our friends that our love can last  
I don't care of who was wrong  
Come back here where you belong  
C'mon baby let's go steady again  
Monday...we said goodbye  
Tuesday..all we did was cry  
Wednesday.I almost lost my mind  
Thursday...I was feelin blue  
Friday..was the same way too  
Never had a day, sad as Saturday  
Even Sunday was no fun day  
Let's go steady again like we used to do  
Say you're ready and then we can start anew  
Seven days we didn't speak it's been a long and lonely week  
C'mon baby, let's go steady again

I walked these streets with you  
Here I am with this old guitar  
Doin' what I do.  
  
I always expected  
That you should see me through  
I never believed in much  
But I believed in you.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
From Marilyn to Madonna  
I always loved your smile  
Now we're headed for the big divorce  
California-style.  
  
I found myself singin'  
Like a long-lost friend  
The same thing that makes you live  
Can kill you in the end.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still stand side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?  
  
Sometime it's distorted  
Not clear to you  
Sometimes the beauty of love  
Just comes ringin' through.  
  
New glass in the window  
New leaf on the tree  
New distance between us  
You and me.  
  
Can we get it together  
Can we still walk side by side  
Can we make it last  
Like a musical ride?

And you will look inside  
The things that you will see  
Will open up your eyes  
  
At any given time  
On every other street  
The city comes to life  
Though everyone's asleep  
A man beats up his wife  
He doesn't want to keep  
Behind closed doors  
They're in retreat  
  
I don't know what makes me stay  
The city life just ain't the same  
There's something wrong with kids today  
I blame the parents anyway  
There's no hope  
No one to trust  
I can't cope  
It's obvious  
Please don't take my drugs away  
I'm gonna give them up someday  
  
There is a place somewhere  
That I could call a home  
I'd live without a care  
I'd never be alone  
One day I will get there  
I feel it in my bones  
I check upon the scores  
I listen to The Coors  
Behind closed doors  
  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors

Take this bread and take this wine

But the world you left behind  
Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound  
And behold your mighty work  
That towers over the uncaring ground  
Of a lesser, darker world

The laces of your shoes  
Must remain behind to testify  
Through an elementary blues  
So, let's walk outside, the hour is late  
Through your crumbs and scattered shells  
Where the awed and the mediocre wait  
Barely fit to ring the bells

And my mother wept  
  
Now, my life was like a river  
All sucked into the ground  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
  
Many miles did I roam  
Through the ice and through the snow  
My horse died on the seventh day  
  
I stumbled into a city  
Where the people tried to kill me  
And I ran in shame  
  
Then I came upon a river  
And I laid my saddle down  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
It knocked me to the ground  
And I said, ""Please, please  
Take me back to my home town""  
Lord, the hammer came down  
  
Now I've been made weak by visions  
Many visions did I see  
All through the night  
  
On the seventh hour an angel came  
With many snakes in all his hands  
And I fled in fright  
  
I pushed off into the river  
And the water came around  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
And it did not make a sound  
And I said, ""Please, please  
Take me back to my home ground""

Don't even mention sex and religion  
And who they take to bed  
But if you see me running down the street  
Know where I'm running to  
I'm tired of honesty being denied us  
I'm coming looking for you  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight

Magazines and t.v.  
There's one man under his big umbrella  
While it's raining on you and me  
Everyday it's getting harder to judge  
Fiction from fact  
I'm tired of truth being denied me  
It's mine and I want it back

Where reality slips from view  
They say that we can't take it  
I think I can, can you?  
  
Don't get me started on blood and thunder  
With people flying blind  
Not caring what or who they take with them  
Or what they leave behind  
It's one mans God against another  
While the river of tears roll by  
The things they do in the name of their father  
Can someone tell me why  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me

Was riding in style  
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard's breaking

She said, ""I hate laser beams  
And you never done see me askin'  
For a UFO  
In Tomahawk County""  
  
Well she kicked the mule  
And it walked the path  
And the aliens fired from behind  
Till she stopped the mule  
And she kicked the rump  
And the big old mule took a big old dump  
  
[Chorus]  
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go  
Take your laser beams away  
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go  
You better stop that laser game  
Or you'll smell my mule

And it saddened her to feel it burn

Kitty said, ""Stop, we ain't lookin' for fightin'  
In Tomahawk County.""

Came on out and said his name was Joe  
She said, ""Come on over for some lemonade  
Just follow me now with the whole brigade""

They had never seen a southern home  
And they liked it, better than their UFO

Here we shower ourselves in lightness""

Do tigers sleep in lily patches?  
Do rhinos run from thunder.

I felt the truth but I still could hear.  
Made me think, I would not be burned,  
But rather give myself to science,  
I felt that I could help  
To science, I felt that I can help  
  
Paranoid the doctor ran,  
Shouting his graphic translation  
All out of order  
Gang wars and ails of riches,  
Spewing forth their color  
He purposely waited till I was done  
To knock on the lavatory door  
Accusing me of ruining the fun,  
He knocked on it some more  
The fun, He knocked on it some more.  
  
And alloy suitors were all inside  
An apple or a grape  
To put forth a cloud of Mercury  
In front of a mighty car  
On a freeway in Los Angeles  
Once the spraying has been done  
'Cause there's more pain from necessity  
You're a portrait of your past,  
There's a mummy in the cabinet.  
Are there no more arrows left?  
  
What's that rubber bottle doing here?  
How's that napkin for a proof  
Ten cents to a dollar now  
For a shelf of pregnant hens  
  
Robert Palmer is employed  
Again, again, again  
So stupendous, living in this tube.

One morning last July  
A boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair  
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself  
For to see I was really there  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head  
And I looked with a feelin' rare  
And I says, says I, to a passer-by  
""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair?""  
He smiled at me and he says's, says's he  
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown  
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann  
She's the star of the County Down""  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there  
I'll dress in my Sunday clothes  
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked  
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose  
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke  
Till my plough turns rust colored brown  
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside  
Sits the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen

Flaunt the right to  
Touch so gently  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?

He was a bit slower than the others.  
When he was quite young  
His mother died at the kitchen table  
While choking on some food.  
  
The fashion of the day  
Was bleach and tied Levi's.  
Donny decided to make some,  
But he didn't know to rinse them.  
  
So he came to school a reekin'.  
Bleach stenched filled the classroom.  
Mrs. Blaileen began to chastise.  
She made him feel like an asshole  
  
Two feet small.  
Oh what a lonely boy.  
Don and Ronald  
They always stuck together  
  
For they were a bit different than the others  
And they were as tight as brothers  
Then Ronald moved away.  
Now Steven  
  
He was year or two younger  
And he really thought he was something.  
He liked to harass other children  
Or anyone he found outnumbered.  
  
Alone Don walks from fishing.  
Steven and his friend they stop him.  
They took his hat and they taunt him,  
Pimp-slap him with a newspaper.  
  
Don lunged forward with his fish knife  
Then ran all the way home weeping.  
He gave his knife to his father and  
Said I think I hurt Steve.  
Oh what a lonely boy.

You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball

""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out  
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out

It makes me better

Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,

We'd ride in limousines  
And their chauffeurs would drive  
When I was thirty-five

I'm in the autumn of my years  
And I think of my life as vintage wine  
From fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs  
And it poured sweet and clear  
It was a very good year

Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.

Though none of us may change  
We all take different routes through life  
But your coach will stay the same. ""

Shot some more in Jackson just to show the world what they can do

Give peace a chance

The army's pulled out leavin' blood on the ground

Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now

So sad they had to fade it

nobody had a horse named Pinto. So I just made him up, made him into a

Will our kids have a hero half as brave or half as strong

We believed that Pinto was the fastest horse alive

You know it's true I'm part of you  
Steady as it comes  
Right down to you  
I've said it all  
So maybe you're a four horse engine  
With a power drive  
A hot kachina who wants into mine  
Take it with your terracide  
We're a bliss  
Of another kind

I wasn't thinking  
My head was in the book  
His hands were on her everywhere  
I saw his face I dropped my coffee  
He's cheating on me with a Hoochie Woman  
  
Ooo hoo hoo you can  
Keep your Hoochie  
Ooo hoo hoo  
And the bank accounts  
Cause boy I bring home the Bacon  
I said boys I bring home the Bacon now  
  
I went to work and the office girls  
Were all burning their poetry  
It wasn't good  
But in the neighborhood  
Now they're all just a  
Hoochie Woman  
  
He called me up  
And said ""she has needs""  
I said ""you'll find 'em  
On Barney's fourth floor""  
He said ""I need a loan""  
(I said) ""that's not a problem  
You better keep this from you

Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need  
On Martha's foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said-  
The part about that  
""Love taking over your life""  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
""Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you""  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done  
  
""Memories that we have yet"" you said  
""To make like our Burning Bed...""  
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe  
On Martha's foolish ginger.

And it's many a grown man has hung his head and cried  
Down in your soul there's one that won't desert you  
Ain't it fine to have the Saviour by your side  
  
Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden  
And faith is the door and love is the key  
And warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows  
And that light, my friend, it shines on you and me  
  
When the wind blows on that faithful morning  
And I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home  
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me  
I'll be batheing in the glory of the throne

Yeah...  
You pick up the phone on the seventh ring  
Even if I don't say my name  
You know who it is by my voice  
The melody that falls naturally from my lips  
But I was most happy when I lost my words  
Even on days when I have problems  
When I see you, they all fly away  
On my rainy days, when I can't see you  
Just by hearing your voice, automatically the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
Just by you looking at me with those eyes  
The excitement won't stop  
I can't say no  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I close my eyes and soon I feel so good  
It's automatic  
Your ambiguous attitude still makes me uneasy  
So being this infatuated with you  
Is still necessary for a while  
Even on the days when your kindness was hard to bear  
You always told the truth  
On rainy days whe I can't cry alone  
If I touch my ring, look, the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
My whole body gets warm  
I can't hide my excitement  
I can't even take a breath  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic  
When I access it  
I try to touch the glittering words  
Inside the computer screen and I feel so warm  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
I don't think you're beloved, just necessary  
It's not because I'm sad  
I just need you  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I feel so good  
It's automatic...  
I just want you here with me  
Tell me why  
It's automatic  
Automatic......

At a table all alone  
A candle burnin' in the darkness  
His glass of wine was almost gone  
And something about him felt familiar  
And it made me stop and stare  
The way he held his hands before him  
Looked like he was lost in prayer  
Hey son, what are you lookin' at?  
Why do your eyes look so sad?  
There's somethin' in the way he sat there  
It made me think about my dad  
I'm lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?  
Bring it over here by my side  
Buy me a glass of wine  
This looks like a real good place to hide  
You know I've always been a fisherman  
Fishin' for souls along the way  
You kind of remind me of my only son  
And I lost him 33 years ago today  
I'm lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
There's somethin' I must give you  
The compass that my father made  
It'll point you in the right direction  
In case you ever lose your way  
You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket  
This is little silver cross  
I think my son would want you to have it  
When you think all the hope is lost  
We're lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
We know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son

What's the matter with me?  
Nothing matters when I'm with my ba-a-by

Let nothing come between us

Who might envy us and try to bring us down  
We know they don't really mean any harm  
That doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around

Got back the blood tests and everything  
Putting on my boutonniere - It's her favorite flower  
Then I'm walking down the altar and I'm gonna take the vow

Light the fuse of temptation and we all burn  
Four horsemen sit high up in the saddle  
And waiting are ride the bloody trail of no return  
  
Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare and  
Wake to find we've been away too long  
This Frankenstein of flash  
Stitched together back from death  
And preying on the souls of everyone

Finally, a chance to say hey,

Yello,/y/yello/beyond+mirrors_20148284.html,Beyond Mirrors,"The age of science has failed  
To explain our universe in rational terms.  
  
Consequently the power of magic  
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  
To fathom the unfathomable.  
  
Our most distinguished scientists  
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  
But some billion creatures,  
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.  
  
Magic is the art of influencing the course  
Of events by the intervention  
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device.  
  
According to Arthur C. Clarke  
Any sufficiently advanced technology  
Is indistinguishable from magic.  
  
Early civilization often mistook  
The unexplainable world around them to be magic.  
  
Rupert Sheldrake in his book  
Seven experiments that could change the world  
Has stated that scientists' attitude  
Toward their experiments affect  
The results of their experiments.  
  
There is no such thing as a definite  
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  
Plays an important part in our rational world.  
  
Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th century  
Physicist has stated that mass  
Is a physical interpretation of energy.  
  
Religious organizations have understood the power of magic  
And therefore monopolized the interpretation  
Of the supernatural to control the human mind.  
  
The universe as a whole is beyond explanation.  
  
Only at the end of the 20th. century  
The Roman-Catholic Church admitted,  
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct.  
  
The second millennium has come to an end.  
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.

Move up fornt and shout out loud !  
Take a stand !  
Take a stand, say what you feel  
Be who you want, but be for real!  
Voice your opinion,  
Don't just sit still  
Speak your mind at your free will  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around !
