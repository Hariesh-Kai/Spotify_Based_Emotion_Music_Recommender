ABBA,/a/abba/kisses+of+fire_20002926.html,Kisses Of Fire,"Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(I'm at the point of no returning)  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions

ABBA,/a/abba/tiger_20002561.html,Tiger,"The city is a jungle, you better take care  
Never walk alone after midnight  
If you don't believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream  
Some of us will dream it forever  
Look around the corner and try not to scream  
It's me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison, you never escape  
You're forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger

And a hole in my brand new shoes  
I got a Margarita nose  
And a breath full of Mad Dog Booze  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Yeah, they threw me outta jail  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
I tried to kiss the judge  
From the electrica' chair  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
The guitar's cranked  
And the bass man's blown a fuse  
And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight

He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.

I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
With me every day till I pass away  
I've been sitting here  
Frightened stiff with fear  
Love has brought it on  
And it must go on  
Being here with you,  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
And here we are, here we are  
All alone for me to take  
And here you are, here you are  
All alone for me to take  
Fell in love today  
Little words to say  
Let us close the door  
That's what doors are for  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines

She was sittin' alone in a crowd  
Listening to the old jukebox playin' a song  
From the moment we walked through the diner door  
She felt something like never before  
A feelin' so strong right from the start  
It wouldn't stop - it was more than a spark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire just won't die  
  
It was gettin' late but they had all night  
They sat there talkin' 'bout their lives  
He was sellin', she uas gettin' ready to buy  
That ole neon light was glowin' dim  
But he could see by the way she was lookin' at him  
Tonight would be different, somethin' had changed  
His lonely heart was feelin' a flame  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
[Bridge]  
She needed him, he needed her  
And they both knew, without a word  
There was no question, there was no doubt  
There was no way they could put it out  
  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each other's eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire, fire on fire

A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moment's hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten

The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
We're on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven

Hang the banners high  
On the outward walls  
The battles lost and won  
That's when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)

When we were living in a dream world,  
Clouds got in the way  
We gave it up in a moment of madness  
And threw it all away  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?  
  
If you believe in the power of magic,  
Its all a fantasy  
So if you need to believe in someone,  
Just pretend its me  
It aint enough that we meet as strangers  
I cant set you free  
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence

I was looking at all the life  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings

But the air was full of sound

It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After two days in the desert sun  
My skin began to turn red  
After three days in the desert fun  
I was looking at a river bed  
And the story it told of a river that flowed  
Made me sad to think it was dead  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After nine days I let the horse run free  
Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground  
And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground  
But the humans will give no love  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

When God gave you the sky  
I knew you'd take the trees  
Son you've grown those chicken wings  
You just can't fly  
  
They anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed  
Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed  
Clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat  
Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree  
  
We could've courted Einstein  
Could've courted Marx  
We could've gone for strolls  
Like other families do in parks  
Son you were born a dud  
In a family without sparks  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
You just can't fly  
  
The checkered flag  
That losers despise  
Never flew in our port  
Or harbored in our eyes  
Cause we always formed that queue  
For second prize  
This family's got those chicken wings  
We just can't fly  
  
Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds  
The tale of this family, is its heads  
We're bouncing on a pogo stick  
Without any springs  
It hurts me to admit this  
But we've got those chicken wings  
  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
And all the luggage that the failure brings  
Is a swallow flying high that sings  
Look he's got those chicken wings  
He may as well die

Don't give up on me yet

Here comes old rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Here come the men faces hidden from the light  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in vegas happens in moline  
On the blue blood streets of boston  
Up in berkeley and out in queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below

Baby, I can always run  
  
To a heart of chrome  
And a soul of steel  
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight.

Woke up in a cold sweat  
In the middle of the night  
Seems like a lifetime  
When youre wondering whos wrong or right  
One confession would resurrect the truth  
Revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo, like a spirit you can't embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror, and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire

Comes the light of day

Oh what a change, what a change that would be  
Just to wake and find you still here,  
'Cause every time, time before  
When I open up my eyes

We could talk about the world and in between,  
And when the morning light was through

To stand for every dream  
And forsake this solid ground  
And give up this fear within  
Of what would happen if they ever knew  
I'm in love with you

Another night away from you  
You're the reason I go on  
And now I need to live the truth  
Right now, there's no better time  
From this fear I will break free  
And I'll live again with love  
And no they can't take that away from me  
And they will see...  
  
I'd surrender everything  
To feel the chance to live again

And this fire is getting stronger, baby  
I'll swallow my pride and I'll be alive  
Can't you hear my call  
I surrender all

To feel the chance to live again

Why in crowds  
Just a trace of my face  
Could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change  
But a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on the ground  
When the messenger  
Wrote me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan  
Who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world  
Could have easily known me much better  
She said  
You're strange, but don't change  
And I let her  
In a while when the smile on my face  
Turned to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who gets sick  
Does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face  
Is moving much faster  
  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know  
Why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
Why don't you ask her

The sport of today is exciting  
The in crowd are into infighting  
When some punk sees some rock-olla  
It's rock and roll all over  
In every street and every station  
Kids fight like different nations  
And it's brawn against brain  
And it's knife against chain  
But it's all young blood  
Flowing down the drain  
  
The Crops hit the Stiffs  
An' the Spikes whipped the Quiffs  
They're all looking 'round  
  
For the last gang in town  
  
Meanwhile down in black town  
Those old soul rebels are haingin' around  
An' when some punk come a looking for sound  
Rastafari goes to ground  
The white heart flipped his pocket dipped  
'cause a black sharp knife never slips  
And they never say to one another  
That tomorrow we might kill our brothers  
  
Down from the edge of London  
The rockabilly rebels came  
From another edge of London  
Skinhead gangs call out their name  
But not the Zydeco kids  
From the high rise  
Though they can't be recognized  
When you hear a Cajun fiddle  
Then you're nearly in the middle  
Of the last gang in town

Proud city fathers used to watch them  
Tears in their eyes

Although, God knows, I may not have met her  
There is a dance an' I should be with her  
There is a town - unlike any other

Hanging out the washing and clipping coupons  
And generally being decent  
  
Johnny too bad meets johnny be good  
In the Charing Cross Road  
That's the only thing that happened today  
Says the west end jungle code  
And all the Germans and all the French  
Jam themselves down the tube  
And re-enact the second world war  
While the rude boys get rude!

And I look to my right  
And I'm looking for a man  
I'm looking for a sign  
I don't want to be the prisoner

Selling revolution  
The prisoner loads his tracking arm up  
With self-disillusion

Your old man digs the garden  
You're only free to dodge the cops  
An' bunk the train to stardom

In my pet-paillated gown,

While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths

When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths

Lived my ol' pappy and we had us a still  
Well we brewed white lightning till the sun went down  
I'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around  
Mighty, mighty pleasin', my daddy's gone squeezin'  
Sssh mercy, white lightning  
  
Oh the G-men, T-men and revenuers too  
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew  
They were lookin' tryin' to book him  
But my daddy kept on cookin', pprrrsss, white lightning  
  
Well my mammy asked pappy what he'd call his brew  
White lightning 'stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Well, lightning started flashing, thunder started crashing  
White lightning!

And I hope you get well  
  
Well done, fried in and out  
Burned to a crisp, if that's what I wish  
I didn't write the rules  
I just follow them to a tee  
Cause that's me, I'm evil  
I'm hateful, I'm sinful, forgetful, mistrustful

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost herd in the sky  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat  
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet  
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name  
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""  
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""  
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

Gino Vannelli,/g/gino+vannelli/here+she+comes_20218643.html,Here She Comes,"Here she comes the ghost of venus de milo  
A touch of madness streaks through her hair  
She'll tear your heart with a poisonous arrow  
She'll rob your soul if you look at her square  
.......... do I dare?  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
Hear she comes the wildest cat in the jungle  
A beast of beauty beyond compare  
I watch the stalkers stalk but they stumble  
The fools rush into vanity fair  
............ but she's not there  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
And all the green eyed women  
Swaying to the rhythm  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
Here she comes

Have I gone to far  
Have I lost my mind  
Where are my eyes  
Oh have I seen to much  
Have I lost my touch  
Losing directions from growing infections  
Poisoned desires of reaping life so young  
  
What will I be like  
When my head is bear  
And my legs are weak  
Will I be strong or barely keep alive  
When I'm thirty-five  
Reaching dimentions that shatter conventions  
Leads me to fear that I'm growing old too soon  
  
With every step and every breath  
It's farther from youth and closer to death  
And that things I've realized  
Now beckon me to shut my eyes  
And I will grow to the age of maybe eighty years  
In such little time  
With this venturous mind  
  
What am I saying  
Don't I know myself from experience  
I'll never change  
Nor cease to sail the sky  
Till the day I die  
I'll come to conclusion with fear or illusion  
I'll live how I feel  
Cause no matter how fast or how slow  
Youth will go

Glee,/g/glee/girl+on+fire_21055908.html,Girl On Fire,"[Verse:]  
She's just a girl and she's on fire  
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway  
She's living in a world and it's on fire  
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away  
  
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh  
She got both feet on the ground  
And she's burning it down  
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh  
She got her head in the clouds  
And she's not backing down  
  
[Chorus:]  
This girl is on fire...  
This girl is on fire...  
She's walking on fire...  
This girl is on fire...  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame  
So bright, she can burn your eyes  
Better look the other way  
You can try but you'll never forget her name  
She's on top of the world  
Hotter than the hottest girls say  
  
Ohhhh oh oh oh  
We got our feet on the ground  
And we're burning it down  
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh  
Got our head in the clouds  
And we're not coming down  
  
[Chorus:]  
This girl is on fire...  
This girl is on fire...  
She's walking on fire...  
This girl is on fire...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Everybody stares, as she goes by  
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes  
Watch her when she's lighting up the night  
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl  
And it's a lonely world  
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby  
  
[Bridge:]  
This girl is on fire...  
This girl is on fire...  
She's walking on fire...

He met a young girl, who suited him nice.  
He went to his Papa to ask his advice.  
His Papa said: Son, I have to say no,  
That girl is your sister, but your Mama don't know!  
  
Woe is me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
Woe, it worries me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
  
A week went by, the summer came down,  
Soon another girl on the island he found.  
He went to his Papa to name the day.  
His Papa shook his head and this time he did say:  
You can't marry this girl, have to say no,  
That girl is your aunty, but your granny don't know! Hey!  
  
Woe is me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
Woe, it worries me. Shame and scandal in the family!  
  
Now he went to his Mama, covered his head,  
And told his Mama what his Papa had said.  
His Mama, she laughed, she said: Go, son, go!  
Your Daddy ain't your Daddy, but your Daddy don't know!

Remember the first time you've faced the dark  
Why were you so afraid?  
Hiding so many secrets inside  
When fearshave got to be tamed  
  
I promisse I'll still be there  
To keep my promisse  
I'll still be there  
  
To watch over dreams at night  
And follow you through the day  
You shot the doors but I'm right behind  
Where shadows remain  
  
I promisse I'll still be there  
To Say I promisse  
I'll still be there  
  
Don't ask me why we'll be like brothers  
Skating on the ice of mortall loneliness

Find a way out of madness  
You dream on (of) paradise  
Who's gonna take you there

HIM,/h/him/soul+on+fire_10139963.html,Soul On Fire,"There's a flame that leads all souls astray  
No one's safe from its tender touch of pain  
Everyday it's looking for new slaves  
To celebrate the beauty of the grave  
  
We are like the living dead  
Sacrificing all we have  
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
We are like the living dead  
Craving for deliverance  
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
  
Again we're falling for disgrace  
And hate will shelter us from the rain  
We are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame  
And gently raped by the light of day  
  
Addicted to our divine despair  
The venom of the cross we bear  
The guilt will follow us to death

Far on the way from L.A.

Looking for water and there's sweat everywhere  
Know that I'm nearer I smell damp air  
I ain't tasted coffee for days  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunters hunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider  
  
Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall  
Damned if I can't remember it all  
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall  
I paid for the funeral crew  
And it seems like I never reach Mexico  
They're heading me off every place that I go  
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low  
What else can an outsider do  
  
I know they're near to me, I don't have to see  
Just let me be the outsider  
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind  
They won't find the outsider  
The outsider  
  
When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound  
Hunter's haunt the outsider.  
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,  
Nothing holds the outsider  
The outsider. The outsider.

What can you do with the drunken hillbilly  
Cut his fucking eyes out and feed em to his Aunt Milly  
Willy Willy chicken neck, chicken hunting gotta love it  
Hit him with the twelve gauge bucket, chicken nuggets  
Laid out all over the grass  
Then his little hound dog will eat em up fast

Blood guts fingers and toes (3x)

So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light

Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore

Ooh - you need a change of place  
Because you've given up on hope  
You're emotionless  
You've no need for love it's just hate, hate, hate.  
But I look at you shaking and it is you  
Who is scraping away  
You who is scraping away.

The Jam,/j/jam/the+combine_20068920.html,The Combine,"And life is very difficult, when you're in the crowd  
When you're in the crowd, you see things as they really are  
You can smell the fear and hate, generated by all around -  
I want to breakaway, but the ties are too strong  
want to go on holiday, but the crowd says I can't  
See life is very different, when you're in the crowd  
Oh, sometimes in the night, I wish I was faraway  
But then I realize, even escape will be in vain  
I want to close my eyes and be like the rest  
I mean, nobody wants to die, although the crowd say they do  
Look, life is very intricate, when you're in the crowd  
Life becomes the movies  
And everyone has a role  
It's easy being the actor  
When the combine's the only star -  
Sunday papers  
And the dailies

Don't let the woman put you six feet  
In the ground, Machine Gun.

Make it in the world of crime.

Careful of what you do, now.  
If you keep listening to your old lady,  
Ain't no telling  
What'll happen to you, now, Machine Gun.  
  
The government boys they came  
For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.  
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison  
Where he lived until his dying day.  
  
Watch out Machine Gun,  
Don't let her put you down.  
Don't let a woman make you  
Out to be a clown, Machine Gun.  
Watch out Machine Gun.

It was then when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
No one else can know of the things that we've been saying  
On the telephone, it would be so bad if they ever knew  
That me and you were secretly into each other

Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you, should've never held your hand

Like somebody else already knows  
Oh my God, I love you both so much  
But to have to choose between the two  
Is hurting me so deep inside

Then crack went my leg like the shell of an egg  
Someone call a decent physician  
I'm no Pete Rose, I can't pretend  
While my mind is quite flexible  
These brittle bones don't bend  
  
I'm growing older but not up

So let the winds of change blow over my head  
I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead  
  
Sometimes I see me as an old manatee  
Heading south as the waters grow colder  
He tries to steer clear of the hum drum so near  
It cuts prop scars deep in his shoulders  
That's how it flows right to the end  
His body's still flexible but that  
Barnacle brain don't bend

So let the winds of change blow over my head  
I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead  
  
So now don't get me wrong  
This is not a sad song  
Just events that I have happened to witness  
And time takes it's toll as we head for the poll  
As the days grow more complicated the night life still wins  
  
I'm growing older but not up  
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck  
So let the winds of change blow over my head

Quiet at night, we stare at the sky

Running away will just change the view  
All I can see is the highway  
All I can see is you

They bring back to memory the happy days of yore  
Gone are the old folk, the house stands deserted  
No light in the window, no welcome at the door  
  
Here's where the children played games on the heather  
Here's where they sailed their wee boats on the burn  
Where are they now? Some are dead, some have wandered  
No more to their home will the children return  
  
Lonely the house now, and lonely the moorland  
The children have scattered, the old folk are gone  
Why stand I here, like a ghost or a shadow?  
Tis time I was movin', tis time I passed on.

Joni Mitchell,/j/joni+mitchell/coyote_20075418.html,Coyote,"No regrets Coyote  
We just come from such different sets of circumstance  
I'm up all night in the studios  
And you're up early on your ranch  
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail  
While the sun is ascending  
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel  
  
There's no comprehending  
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes  
And the lips you can get  
And still feel so alone  
And still feel related  
Like stations in some relay  
You're not a hit and run driver, no, no  
Racing away  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway  
  
We saw a farmhouse burning down  
In the middle of nowhere  
In the middle of the night  
And we rolled right past that tragedy  
Till we turned into some road house lights  
Where a local band was playing  
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor  
And the next thing I know  
That Coyote's at my door  
He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""  
  
He drags me out on the dance floor  
And we're dancing close and slow  
Now he's got a woman at home  
He's got another woman down the hall  
He seems to want me anyway  
Why'd you have to get so drunk  
And lead me on that way  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway  
  
I looked a Coyote right in the face  
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town  
He went running through the whisker wheat  
Chasing some prize down  
And a hawk was playing with him  
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes  
He had those same eyes - just like yours  
Under your dark glasses  
Privately probing the public rooms  
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors  
Where the players lick their wounds  
And take their temporary lovers  
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play  
  
No regrets, Coyote  
I just get off up aways  
You just picked up a hitcher  
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway  
  
Coyote's in the coffee shop  
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs  
He picks up my scent on his fingers  
While he's watching the waitresses' legs  
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy  
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides  
And the air conditioned cubicles  
And the carbon ribbon rides  
Are spelling it out so clear  
Either he's going to have to stand and fight  
Or take off out of here  
I tried to run away myself  
To run away and wrestle with my ego  
And with this flame  
You put here in this Eskimo  
In this hitcher  
In this prisoner  
Of the fine white lines  
Of the white lines on the free, free way

Safaris to the heart of all that jazz  
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes  
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights  
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews  
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine  
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue  
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line  
  
In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer  
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear  
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive  
They'll eat a working girl like her alive  
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand  
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines  
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band  
He hangs it up above the jungle line  
  
The jungle line, the jungle line  
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time  
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind  
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in  
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke  
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine  
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats  
Charging, chanting down the jungle line  
  
There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb  
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room  
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet  
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit  
And metal skin and ivory birds  
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines  
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge  
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line

Bow down as I petrify

Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes!

Black as night, faster than a shadow  
Crimson flare from a raging sun  
An exhibition, of sheer precision  
Yet no one knows from where he comes  
  
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown  
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground

But they didn't last and they died as they tried

I see what I put you through  
And I'll make it up to you

How differently I feel  
That I can be true to you  
That my love is real  
  
But my past will forever haunt me  
If you say that you don't want me  
I'm down on my knees

Soon the whole street starts to shake  
When you hear they hear the drummer boy!

When he plays 'em he just slays 'em!

Every day's a happy day  
Everything will be OK

Gather round, all you chums  
Watch this cat, spin those drums  
Swing it Brother, beat that hyde!

But now the only thing that I can believe is gods word, his holy word.  
But even now my doubts will open up for me a world that I just despise.  
And then the shades come down, the light turn off,  
And I'm left alone with my helpless cries.  
When I hear all his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up,  
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.  
  
I want to go around the world and prove Jesus lives, you know he lives.  
And were not only friends, were family, were relatives, relatives.  
But when I'm far from home and so alone, and my imagined fears get so over-
sized.  
That's when I listen to the one no one should listen to, and get fooled by his
disguise.  
Feeling weak from his lies, all of his bad wicked lies,  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you get fooled, don't you even open up,  
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.  
  
If you're well read, you probably know how the story goes.  
That wolf can look so good especially dressed in the right clothes, the wooly
clothes.  
And as he starts to knit the counterfeit hell totally make you feel like
you're paralyzed.  
Hell keep you spun around and looking down,  
Just when you should be looking straight to the skies.  
Pleading help from his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.  
If you believe and your faith just dies.  
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up, or expose yourself,  
To one of his wicked lies, to one of his wicked lies.

Duff you up and touch you up,  
And then he's gonna screw you up.  
Even though he's mean on you,  
There's nothing else that you can do  
Just sit back and take his abuse.  
He will smile at you, be so sweet to you.  
Then he's gonna cheat on you.  
  
You'd better run, you'd better fly.  
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.  
Lock your doors and stay inside.

Once we loved and trusted him,  
Now his thugs and bullies make us live in sin.  
They suppress us, oppress us, molest us, possess us.  
  
You'd better run, you'd better fly.  
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.  
And lock your doors and stay inside.

I'm on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love  
  
I'm a prisoner  
A prisoner of love  
I have been captured  
And kept underground  
I have been tortured  
But I don't make a sound  
'Cause I know one day  
One day I will be found  
  
All this mass confusion  
Causes chaos in my brain  
I'm on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love  
With all of the illusions  
I won't ever be the same  
I'm on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love

Lenny Kravitz,/l/lenny+kravitz/if+you+want+it_20687583.html,If You Want It,"Don't you let it all pass you by  
Looking through life's window pane  
Don't you sit around wasting time  
That would be a crying shame  
There's a power that's deep inside  
And it burns just like a flame  
Just believe and you will see that God  
Will shower you like pouring rain  
If you want it  
You can change your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
There's a reason  
For you to explore  
Why you're here  
What do you say  
And the beauty is that you're the one  
Who controls just how you play  
There's a choice that you need to make  
One is ore and one is clay  
So drop your chains and take up your cross  
And let Jesus make your way  
If you want it  
You can change  
Your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
If you want it  
You can change your evil ways  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
  
If you want it  
You can change your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
If you want it  
You can change your evil ways  
If you want it  
  
Just break free  
And walk away

Too hard to break

Can't tell if this is true or dream  
Deep down inside I feel to scream  
This terrible silence stops me  
  
Now that the war is through with me  
I'm waking up, I can now see  
That there is not much left of me  
Nothing is real but pain now  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh please, God, wake me  
  
Back to the womb that's much too real  
In pumps life that I must feel  
But can't look forward to reveal  
Look to the time when I'll live  
  
Fed through the tube that sticks in me  
Just like a wartime novelty  
Tied to machines that make me be  
Cut this life off from me  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh please, God, wake me  
  
Now the world is gone, I'm just one  
Oh God, help me  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh please, God, help me  
  
Darkness imprisoning me  
All that I see  
Absolute horror  
I cannot live  
I cannot die  
Trapped in myself  
Body my holding cell  
  
Landmine has taken my sight  
Taken my speech  
Taken my hearing  
Taken my arms  
Taken my legs  
Taken my soul  
Left me with life in hell

I was hiding, dear, hiding all way  
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way  
  
You went to the museum  
You climbed a spiral stair  
You searched for me all among  
The knowledgeable air  
I was hidden, babe, hiding all away  
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away  
  
You entered the cathedral  
When you heard the solemn knell  
I was not sitting with the gargoyles  
I was not swinging from the hell  
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away  
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away

He touched you with his fingers  
Sent sparks zapping out your face

They said, he's up to his same old tricks  
They leered at you with their baby blues  
And rubbed jelly on their sticks  
I had to get out of there, babe, hiding all away  
I had to get out of there, dear, hiding all away  
  
You searched through all my poets  
From Sappho through to Auden  
I saw the book fall from your hands  
As you slowly died of boredom  
I had been there, dear,  
But I was not there anymore  
I had been there, now I'm hiding all way  
  
You walked into the ball of fame  
And approached my imitators

Some were eating cold potatoes

He basted you with butter, babe  
And made you crawl inside

Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears  
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.  
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore.  
  
You make this all go away  
You make this all go away  
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away  
You make it all go away  
I just want something  
I just want something I can never have  
  
You always were the one to show me how  
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.  
This thing is slowly taking me apart.  
Grey would be the color if I had a heart.  
  
You make this all go away

I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away

I just want something I can never have  
  
In this place it seems like such a shame.  
Though it all looks different now,  
I know it's still the same  
Everywhere I look you're all I see.  
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be.

As long as there's one spark to see us through

So many broken dreams  
Too many lovers lost  
In the lonely crowd

Say that you won't go  
Promise you won't go  
Say that you won't go

Don't let the fire burn out  
Don't let the fire burn out

Tele he's the one he knows what to say  
Knows how to find his own way  
He knows the roads by night and by doorways  
But watching the light in a hall  
Won't change a thing or say at all  
What it is that he says  
  
Still he says that I don't know  
Still he says that I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't why I think about so much  
When I don't know what it is I can't say  
And I wouldn't change a thing if I believe you all  
And scream it in your face  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
Tele deals the cards and draws an ace  
And finds himself miles away  
Where skies ain't bruised by towers and fumes  
Children ain't too young to play  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all  
But we're born different days  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all but we were born on different days  
  
I'd change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away...

Oingo Boingo,/o/oingo+boingo/change_20102701.html,Change,"Don't you ever wonder why, nothing ever seems to change  
If it does it's for the worse, seems it's just a modern curse  
Sometimes when I take a peek outside of my little cage,  
Everyone looks so asleep, will they die before they wake  
And, hey. . . Don't you know? We're just products of our time and Hey . . .  
What d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Better dumb and happy than smart and without any friends  
Better cute and better loud, better join up with the crowd  
Keep up or be left behind, there's a dust storm in my mind  
Seems I can't see straight these days, doesn't matter anyway  
Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times and  
Hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now. The one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change  
Do you want to change? Do you want to change right now?  
Do you want to change . . . I like my stupid life, just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs  
And I like you just the way you are, I like your face just the way it is  
And I wouldn't even change it for a herd of screaming kids  
And I like you just the way you are, I like you though you may not like me
back  
I would dazzle you with brilliance, if I only had the knack  
'Cause I like you just the way you are, I like this life just the way it is  
And the castles all around me, have been melting now for years  
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here  
All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears  
And I'm dreaming again . . . Floating in a pool of mud  
Try to get back where I was and I don't really care  
Got a little talking to, by the mirror in my room, and I don't really care . .
.  
Whispering voices from the dead, come from underneath my bed  
And I don't really care . . .  
I like my stupid life just the way it is  
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs  
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said  
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead  
And I'm dreaming again . . . and I'm dreaming again . . .  
Baby - sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes you're so far away, tell me what to do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Sometimes I just can't believe everything you do  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you  
Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Getting harder all the time, harder now to see  
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me  
Light another cigarette, have another dream  
It's the same thing every day, nothing ever seems to change and I . . .  
Do you really want to change?  
Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul.  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke  
Why is everyone upset? I once knew but I forget. Something happened,  
Something strange, something it appears has changed  
Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times  
And hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine  
Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -  
Oh God, here's that question now, the one that makes me go insane  
I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change

Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?  
Heaven, is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you  
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tradgedy?  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same?  
  
Sometimes, it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams  
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me  
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart and taste the blood from my blade  
And when we sleep would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave?  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same?  
  
Will you ever take me?  
No I just can't take the pain  
Would you ever trust me?  
No I'll never feel the same (oh)  
  
(instrumental)  
  
I know I've been so hard on you  
I know I've told you lies  
If I could have just one more wish  
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged?  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same? (Oh yeah)

And wake up from this nightmare

So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazed  
  
Dressed in black from head to toe  
Two guitars across our backs  
We would walk the city roads  
Seeking someone who would listen to the music  
That we were writing down at home  
  
But they can't take it from me, if they try  
I lived through those early days  
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazy  
  
Hair slicked back with Vaseline  
Like the pictures on the wall  
Of the local record shop  
Hearing noises we were destined to remember  
We willed the thrill to never stop  
  
May sweet memories of friends from the past  
Always come to you, when you look for them  
And your inspiration, long may it last  
May it comes to you time and time again  
  
Now everybody seems to have their own opinion  
Who did this and who did that  
But as for me I don't see how they can remember  
When they weren't where it was at  
  
And they can't take it from me, if they try

Pushed it through a horn 'till it was worn,

They all have hills to fly them on except for Lin Tai Yu  
Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games  
Hiding out in tree-tops shouting out rude names  
Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside  
Whistling tunes we piss on the goons in the jungle

Peter Gabriel,/p/peter+gabriel/growing+up_20107553.html,Growing Up,"Folded in your fleshy purse  
I am floating once again  
While the muted sounds are pumping rhythm  
All the walls close in on me  
Pressure's building wave on wave  
Till the water breaks - and outside I go, oh  
  
One dot, that's on or off, defines what is and what is not, one dot  
Two dot, a pair of eyes, a voice, a touch, complete surprise, two dot  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
Three dot, a trinity, a way to map the universe  
Three dot  
Four dot, is what will make a square, a bed to build on, it's all there,  
Four dot  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
All the slow clouds pass us by  
Make the Empire State look high  
As you take me in your sea-stained sweetness  
It spills, it tingles and it stings  
All the pleasure that it brings  
'Til the door has let the outside inside here  
  
Well on the floor there's a long wooden table  
On the table there's an open book  
On the page there's a detailed drawing  
And on the drawing is the name I took  
  
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown  
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live  
Growing up, growing up,

My ghost likes to travel  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside  
My ghost likes to travel  
Moving inside of your space  
  
The breathing stops, I don't know when  
In transition once again  
Such a struggle getting through these changes  
And it all seems so absurd  
To be flying like a bird  
When I do not feel I've really landed here.

He was sleeping in the sunbeams on the old zoo floor.  
I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play,  
It's called called Villa Borghese and it's on the way  
To East Africa.  
  
Down on Grand Comoro Island, where I grew past four,  
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor,  
And the wind laughed, and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say,  
Here's a child who'll want the world to go his way  
In East Africa, in East Africa.  
  
Suddenly for me the world turned upside down  
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound.  
  
Dark shadows, sounds of thunder raging over me,  
Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy'  
Where's my East Africa?  
  
Well they said, they said, they said (the ones who know it all)  
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall,  
So I took my parents' hands, I lifted my head to say  
I'll just have to be a hero, there's no other way!  
Back to East Africa  
Back to East Africa  
Back to East Africa  
Come with me I'm going back, going back to East Africa.

Racing to be first  
Her ruby fruit jungle  
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth  
The baby was a boy  
But I think what stunned her  
Is that this bare breasted baby  
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder  
Crackin' from his thumb bone  
Came felonious thunder  
Fill the sky with hellfire  
From way down down down under  
  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I get all the bush I can  
  
Erupting from the ground  
In Hollywood he glowed  
His jungle turned to concrete  
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone  
Like a full blown volcano  
I must let it be known  
That through this boy's vein  
Atomic lava blood flows and flows  
His soul shocking sounds  
They make the mountains moan  
This boy's become a man  
It's time to take take take  
Take the throne  
  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I get all the bush I can

Ano bang dapat kong gampanan  
Sa daigdig na ating ginagalawan  
Ang hangganan ko ba'y hanggang saan  
  
Babae ako  
Ako ba'y mayro'ng kapangyarihan  
O ako'y isa lamang na bukal  
Na pagkukunan ng pagmamahal  
  
Nais kong lumipad na may sariling bagwis  
Nais kong marating pangarap nang mabilis  
Nais kong manguna sa mga maya  
Para makita ang bagong umaga  
Ngunit kailan pa  
Gusto ko na  
Ngayon na  
  
May galit ako  
Ngunit pag-asa'y nasa puso ko  
  
Bukas ang hamog makikita mo  
Hihigupin niya ang paru-paro...

By: Regine Velasquez  
Composed by: Keno  
Produced by: Ronnie Henares  
  
Will there really be a morning  
When the night is gone  
Will there be a dawn  
To greet me urge me to go on  
Is there no home for me  
To even love again  
  
Will there really be a morning  
Or is this the end  
Will there really be a sunrise when  
The darkness dies  
Will the strength to last'll be there  
To fight the fears inside  
The nights are so endless  
Endless as it seems  
  
Will there really be a morning or  
Is this a dream  
Days have come and days have passed  
I wish the morning stayed  
I pray that they would last  
For in those mornings I  
Could see what it meant to be free  
Will there really be light again  
When this tunnel fades  
Will I reach out and touch it  
Ir will I be afraid  
I just hoped that  
I'll still be there just that  
I may see  
Will there really be a morning to  
Come for me  
For in those mornings  
I could see what it meant  
To be free  
  
Will there really be a morning to  
Come for me

In a lonely farmer's town

Ain't gonna turn your head around

Just pick up the telephone  
And the son of a poor man will bring you home.

Painted lips and fingers singing for the world  
A fashion plate for sure dancin' for your plastic world  
Call me up if you can but if not well I'll understand

I don't need the aggravation  
I'm a lazy slob  
I hang fire, I hang fire  
Hang fire, put it on the wire  
We've got nothing to eat  
We got nowhere to work  
Nothing to drink  
We just lost our shirts  
I'm on the dole  
We ain't for hire  
Say what the hell  
Say what the hell, hang fire

Doo doo doo  
Take a thousand dollars go have some fun  
Put it all on at a hundred to one

Out through the window

Cool silver fingernails  
I used to watch her from the bar  
Following her car

To wander in the light of stars.

Winds would knock and disappear.

Like the first time you were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,  
You left me,  
You told me you would stay.  
  
You never said goodbye  
And I'll keep asking why,  
I keep on asking how,  
Oh come unto me now.  
  
I have breathed the morning air,  
I have heard the four winds blow.  
I was weary but prepared to follow  
Down this lonely road.  
  
In the room where lovers sleep,  
Winds would knock and disappear.  
Still I felt the music near,  
Like the first time we were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,

While she'll dish out the soft shoe  
If makin' money doesn't suit your mind  
We've got something here  
Here for you  
You can sit there and suck your thumb  
Hear the rock and roll hum  
But you're just a crazy wall flower  
'Til you join all your friends on the floor  
And do the...

you'll think your goin' blind  
Take your clothes off and start to shake  
Shake rattle and roll  
Watch the walls and the ceiling quake  
Let it move your body and soul  
And do the...  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
You'll see the oceans part  
you'll think your goin' blind.

Sting,/s/sting/ghost+story_20132022.html,Ghost Story,"I watch the western sky  
The sun is sinking  
The geese are flying south  
It sets me thinking  
I did not miss you much  
I did not suffer  
What did not kill me  
Just made me tougher  
I feel the winter come  
His icy sinews,  
Now in the firelight  
The case continues  
Another night in court  
The same old trial  
The same old questions asked  
The same denial  
The shadows closing round  
Like jury members  
I look for answers in  
The fire's embers  
Why was I missing then  
That whole December?  
I give my usual line,  
I don't remember  
Another winter comes  
His icy fingers creep  
Into these bones of mine  
These memories never sleep  
And all these differences  
A cloak I borrowed  
We kept our distances  
Why should it follow that  
I must have loved you?  
What is the force that binds the stars?  
I wore this mask to hide my scars  
What is the power that pulls the tide?  
Never could find a place to hide  
What moves the earth around the sun?  
What could I do but run and run and run?  
Afraid to love, afraid to fail  
A mast without a sail  
The moon's a fingernail  
And slowly sinking  
Another day begins  
And now I'm thinking  
That this is indifference  
Was my invention  
When everything I did  
Sought your attention  
You were my compass star  
You were my measure  
You were a pirate's map  
Of buried treasure  
If this was all correct  
The last thing I'd expect  
The prosecution rests  
It's time that I confessed  
I must have loved you  
I must have loved you

But when you think of all the lonely nights  
And I see that look in your eyes  
I'd say it's time to simplify your thinking  
  
Why does it have to be so hard  
To play your hand and show your cards  
If you will I will  
If you will I will  
  
Before you get your just desserts  
Let me clear your table first  
Have you, have you had your fill

Proud of what I have done

Give ourselves away?

Want to stay  
  
Make him stay

Shut your power down  
  
You must uncreate  
That  
Destructive tendency  
  
Let your fire  
Start to  
Heal the fury  
Sister its time  
To bring it  
Back online  
  
As Job's coffin looks down  
Job's coffin looks down  
  
To see what you're gonna do  
To see what you're gonna do

Makes you try to explain  
Makes you forgive and forget

if it comes to blows  
Are you so sure you won't be crawling

Why risk falling  
  
If everything you think you know  
Makes your life unbearable  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you'd broken every rule and vow  
And hard times come to bring you down  
Would you change?  
Would you change?

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
  
I-I-I I've got a migraine.  
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways.  
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays  
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days.  
  
I don't know why they always seem so dismal.  
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle.  
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed  
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.  
Let it be said what the headache represents  
It's me defending in suspense  
It's me suspended in a defenseless test  
Being tested by a ruthless examiner  
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts.  
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock.  
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead  
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.

I am not as fine as I seem.  
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens  
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me  
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees.  
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait.  
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead  
And how it is a door that hold's back contents  
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent.  
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence  
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find  
I did not know it was such a violent island  
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.  
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin  
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win.  
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find  
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind.  
  
Am I the only one I know,  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.  
  
And I will say that we should take a day to break away  
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone.  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.

And the cold wind cut through me, it cut right through my clothes  
And the anger and the yearning, like fever in my veins  
Set the fire burning  
  
She came down from Knightstown with her hands hard from the line  
From the first time I laid eyes on her I know that she'd be mine  
Her father was a lawman, he swore he'd shoot me dead  
'Cause he knew I wanted Jeannie and I'd have'r her like I said  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Shooter like me  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Shooter on her side  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
  
We met down by the river on the final day in May  
And when I leaned down to kiss her, she did not turn away  
I drew out all my money and together we did vow  
To meet that very evening, and get away somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The night was cold and rainy down by the borderline  
I was riding hard to meet her when a shot rang out behind  
As I lay there in the darkness with a pistol by my side  
Jeannie and her father rode off into the night  
Jeannie needs a shooter.

Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver,  
Couldn't hide away, hide away.  
  
He controlled the horses with a hand clap or a whisper,  
Drink he couldn't combat but he knew he was no sinner,  
Couldn't hide away, hide away.  
  
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,  
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink  
Not to hide away, hide away.

A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,  
Just to hide away, hide away.

Tell the world what you're about  
Let them hear your screams, your shouts (out loud!)  
Don't hold back, don't let down

I'm letting go of all I'm hiding  
I'm in over my head  
But I'm not afraid  
To dive in deep and make some waves

Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout some more

And there's a voice inside  
And all it wants is to be heard

There's so much more to see  
My hopes, my dreams designed with destiny  
I was fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made me more  
He made me more than skin deep  
?Cause I am more, I am more than skin deep  
So much more  
It's so hard to change  
When we are captive to ourselves  
Always thirsty for something else  
But free or enslaved  
We are sons, we are daughters  
Called out by the Father's name  
So take the fire and let it burn  
Unleash the voice inside  
?Cause everyone needs to be heard  
Beyond skin deep  
There's so much more to see  
Our hopes, our dreams designed with destiny  
We were fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made us more  
He made us more than skin deep  
?Cause we are more, we are more than skin deep  
So much more  
We are more than the future  
We are more than the past  
We were made to bring glory  
Given souls that will last  
We are more than our bodies  
We are more than the grave  
We were bought by His blood  
And from ourselves we've been saved

Choke the chicken, hum the knob, squeezing the tomata.  
I've looked at Ms. November now I'n gonna decorate her.  
Hey Masturbata!  
Buffing the banana, Mr. Lizard shaking bacona,  
Pounding on the flounder and it's mayonnaise I'm makinga.  
Spank the frank, wax the carrot, god my hand is achinga.  
Hey Masturbata!

I met someone by accident  
It blew me away  
It blew me away  
  
It was in the darkest of my days  
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  
And buried them away, you buried them away  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
Drop you off at the train station  
Put a kiss on top of your head  
Watch you wave  
Watched you wave  
  
Then I went on home to your skyscrapers  
Neon lights and waiting papers  
That you call home  
I call it home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
I woke up feeling heavy hearted  
I'm going back to where I started  
The morning rain, the morning rain  
Although I wish that you were here  
That same old road that brought me here  
Is calling me home, It's calling me home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
And I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Keeping myself to myself  
Can't pretend that it's been easy since you went away  
Living with somebody else  
  
If you should change your mind  
If you should turn around and look behind  
If you could see me the way I used to be  
At the risk of bringing back the sorrow and despair  
  
I would do it all again  
Holding on to memories and pretending not to care  
Knowing that the show was soon to end  
If only I could change your mind  
  
If only you would change  
If I had the chance I'd do it all again

Drifting along with the tide  
And the joy of simple things and ordinary ways  
Taking it all in my stride  
  
If you should change your mind  
If I could let you see what lies behind  
If you could see need me the way it used to be  
  
Even for the moment of the happy times we shared  
Living in my dreams since then  
At the risk of losing only castles in the air

To the times in my life when I could not bear to lose  
A simple game.  
And the least of it all was the fortune and the fame...  
But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun...  
Was I to know?  
For the last thing of all that was on my mind  
Was the close at the end of the show.

Is not the same.  
And the jest of it all is I can't recall my name.  
But I cling to a hope till I can't hold on anymore...anymore...  
And for all the acclaim, I am all alone!

I've seen through terrorists' eyes  
Sometims I feel no emotion  
Sometims I break down and cry  
I need to walk on a wire  
I need a layer of skin  
I need a preacher breathing fire  
To burn away my sins  
  
And I can't help the victims  
On the side of the road  
And I can't stop the cyclone  
That's about to explode

Watching all the clouds roll by  
I see the blood moon rising  
I know I'm way too young to die

You see, she's his little rag  
Nothing more than just a waif  
And he's mopping up his need  
She is tired and afraid  
Maybe she'll find a way  
Through these awful years  
To disappear

Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven

Nobody's naming names

For a creaking in the house  
But no one's left to harm her

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string  
I'd say that I had Spring fever  
But I know it isn't Spring

Like a nightingale without a song to sing  
Oh, why should I have Spring fever  
When it isn't even Spring?  
  
I keep wishing I were somewhere else  
Walking down a strange new street  
Hearing words that I have never heard  
From a girl I've yet to meet  
  
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams  
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing  
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing  
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way  
That it might as well be Spring  
  
It might as well be Spring

And when the rain would fall down,  
I'd just stare out my window.  
  
Dreaming of what could be,  
And if I'd end up happy.  
I would pray.  
  
Trying not to reach out  
But when I try to speakout  
Felt like no one could hear me  
  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Wanna feel the warm breeze.  
Sleep under a palm tree.  
Feel the rush of the ocean.  
Get onboard a fast train.  
Travel on a jetplane.  
Far away,  
And break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors.  
Swinging with revolving doors.  
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me.  
Gotta keep movin on movin on.  
Fly away,  
Break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye,  
Take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget the place I come from,  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
I should Breakaway.

Those who feared cancer never had much to say  
They bored us at parties onto forty a day  
They forced us into corners and onto forty a day  
  
The dentiist's chair is the only time  
That anybody ever looks at their mouth  
Let the dentist give their teeth something to chatter about  
  
School like life turns some men into mice  
To avoid the rat-trap take the mouse's advice  
  
Well they say be wary of strangers  
Especially if they offer you sweets  
But there ain't no government health warning  
On half the mad fuckers you meet  
  
Save yourself personal tradegy  
Go back to the man with the sweets  
Do yourself schooling favour  
Head back to the man with the sweets

Singing loola lullabies

With black Spanish eyes  
And a smile to remind him of heaven

Washed in the tears for a love that lays dying

Between big red sunsets big yellow moons  
Tears in his eyes stones in his shoes  
Howling Wolf in his blues

Never know how much I care.  
When you put your arms around me,  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me.  
Fever when you hold me tight.  
Fever in the morning.  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Sun lights up the daytime,  
And moon lights up the night.  
I light up when you call my name,  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right.  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me.  
Fever when you hold me tight.  
Fever in the morning,  
And fever all through the night.  
  
Everybody's got the fever.  
That is something you all know.  
Fever isn't such a new thing.  
Fever started long ago.  
  
Romeo loved Juliet.  
Juliet, she felt the same.  
When he put his arms around her,  
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame.  
  
Thou giveth fever when we kisseth.  
Fever with thy flaming youth.  
Fever, I'm afire.  
Fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth.""  
  
Cap'n Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair.  
When her daddy tried to kill him,  
She said, ""Daddy, oh, don't you dare.  
  
He gives me fever with his kisses.  
Fever when he holds me tight.  
Fever, I'm his missus,  
So Daddy, won't you treat him right.""  
  
Now you've listened to my story,  
Here's the point that I have made:  
Chicks were born to give you fever,  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade.  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them.  
Fever if you live and learn.  
Fever 'til you sizzle.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.

But, lord, the only thing I hear  
Is you whisperin' in my ear  
The words that you used to say  
Well, now the days grow longer  
My love grows stronger  
And the fever gets worse every day  
  
I got a fever for a girl

Nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
I can remember comin' home  
See you standin' at the stove  
With the dishes on the table  
Dinner ready to go  
Or maybe out to a movie show  
Something that you'd like to see  
Oh, you were my sun in the morning  
And my moon at night  
When you put your arms around me  
Made me fell alright  
Well, now the days grow longer  
And my love just grows stronger  
And the fever gets so bad at night  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever

It's gonna be alright, now  
If I can make it to the morning  
I'm gonna be alright, now  
If I can just make it to the morning  
  
It's just this long and lonely nights  
Every time I close my eyes  
All I see is her face  
Every time I shut my eyes  
All I see is her face  
But I'm gonna be alright, now  
I'll be alright, now  
When I shut down all the lights  
When I turn off all the lights  
When I turn down all the lights  
And when I lay my head on the pillow  
I can't stop myself in thinking  
""Baby, where are you tonight? ""  
""Where is she tonight? ""

And it may seem like it's breaking the thread

To where only the strong get through  
You've got keep on believing or you'll lose your way  
Cause it slips right out of view  
Though there are days the light can flicker and fade

Cause there is a dream deep inside my head  
And it may seem like it's breaking the thread

Waiting for their hearts to be broken

Christina Aguilera,/c/christina+aguilera/hurt_20471104.html,Hurt,"Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face  
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away  
If only I knew what I know today  
Ohhh ohhh  
  
I would hold you in my arms  
I would take the pain away  
Thank you for all you've done  
Forgive all your mistakes  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To hear your voice again  
Sometimes I want to call you, but I know you won't be there  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself by hurting you  
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit  
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss  
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this  
  
Would you tell me I was wrong?  
Would you help me understand?  
Are you looking down upon me?  
Are you proud of who I am?  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To have just one more chance  
To look into your eyes and see you looking back  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that  
I've missed you since you've been away  
  
Oh, it's dangerous  
It's so out of line to try to turn back time  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
By hurting you

To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
They'll take your money  
And then take your health  
To line their pockets with unequalled wealth  
Those men are under the power of gold  
We won't be safe until we shut them down  
  
Face the fire  
You can't turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waiting's over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
The people came to the capitol town  
One hundred thousand of them laid their hearts down  
They screamed in anger and broadcast their fears  
Just to have them fall on deaf ears  
  
Face the fire  
You can't turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waiting's over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
Kill the fire and turn to the sun

In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find.  
  
Now the dream is rising  
In a moment it will be past  
This breath is my first  
It will all too soon be my last.  
  
And on a windy coast  
I made several toasts  
To you and me and the sea  
And no one heard.  
  
Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.  
  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find.

Yea we could do anything

'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same  
You know I'll hate to leave you girl but I'm so glad I came  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up, scream and shout  
Fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out

Innocence lost, satisfy my appetite  
Surrender to the flame, what's your name  
Let's get down to business, how can you refuse  
Give this boy a helping hand, come on light my fuse

That's what I stand for  
Since our possibilities  
In a world out of control  
  
You're looking for a miracle  
To spray the air feel the rain  
Since you're out of control  
Married to pain  
  
Which way forever  
Which way will I go  
Which way forever  
There's no heroes  
  
Take me back, take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
  
Close your eyes and pretend  
That you're a bird in the sky  
Turn your face to the wind  
I know you can learn to fly  
  
Which way forever  
Which way will I go  
Which way forever  
There's no heroes  
  
Take me back, take me out  
Back to the future

Believe that you can  
You can make a stay  
We can change the world  
I know we can  
  
You gotta take me back, take me out

Nobody knows him  
Any better than I  
  
Says without me  
He can get along  
But I know that's just a man's way  
Of saying he's strong  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
Oh, I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
If I do something to please him  
He never gives me credit  
If I think he'll bring me candy and roses  
Huh, I might as well forget it  
  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes his privacy  
And when a mood hits him  
I know when to let him be  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny, funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
Sometimes when he hurts me so bad  
I think I've got migraine in the head  
All he has to do is touch me  
Tears disappear  
I'll forgive him in a minute  
  
I have to pretend  
There ain't much I know  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes to run the show  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
Though sometimes he brings me little tears  
  
Still love the man he is

Someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Well, I might try to be  
Your friend again  
But your restless heart  
And rovin' eyes  
My jealousy, these endless fights  
I've got to get out of your life  
Or I will never mend  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And I don't have the heart to  
Stay, and I can't take the pain  
I know we've tried to no avail  
Our heaven now has  
Turned to hell  
The same old hurt  
We know so well  
And something's got  
To change  
We both know it's got to end  
The passion's gone  
It's just pretend  
And one of us have got  
To make the move  
We might as well just give it up  
We've lost respect and  
There's no trust  
And without this, there's  
No real love  
It's just some sad excuse  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And there's nothing left but walk away  
Ain't this a crying shame  
A change of pace  
A change of heart  
A change of place  
A place to start  
And we'll be better off apart  
Our only chance is change  
And we never wil  
But something has to change  
But someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Then I will try to be your friend again  
But I don't want to see  
Your face 'til then  
Change, I need a change  
I need a change  
We need a change

Hollowing souls

And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven

Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
And the name I'm calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So sweep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me

'Coz when you walked right out that door of mine  
It made me wonder why there are tears  
Where is the end to all these tears  
Where's the face that use to cheer me up  
Girl, that makes me wonder  
Why does my hear tjust keep on beating  
Why do my arms just keep on reaching  
To someone who's no longer there  
  
What can I say besides I'm sorry  
What can I say to change your mind  
What can I do to make tomorrow yours and mine  
  
[Chairs]  
Why do there have to be chairs  
It shows its empty now  
There's no one there  
It really makes me wonder  
  
Why does my heart just keep on beating  
Why do my arms just keep on reaching  
For someone who's no longer there  
  
What can I say besides I'm sorry  
What can I say to changed your mind  
Why do I keep on holding on  
A chance you'll walk back through the door  
When my heart knows there's no hope anymore  
Why do there have to be doors2x

I do believe I'll find myself a new place

Insane and rising in my own weird way

We need to get away from the world outside.  
Way from the world,  
Need to find the place where we can hide  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Yeah, somewhere under a volcano.  
We can hide inside a volcano  
We can find the good life on the inside.  
  
I like the crazy way you look at me,  
Without the drugs we can be what we're afraid to be.  
I remember what it's like to be clean and insane  
I remember what is that makes me need to get away.  
Away from of world  
We need to get away from the world outside.  
Away from the world,  
We need to find a place where we can hide, yeah  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Where my chain can pass from black to white  
They may let us out this time, oh.  
I made some mistakes, I paid the price  
I walked away clean, you know I did my time.  
You've been waiting for years, waiting for me.  
Waiting to leave so we can find a dream  
We can live under volcano with the fire all around  
We can lose yourself inside a dream  
In the middle of the northern sound.  
Get away from the world  
We need to get away from the world  
Gotta get away from the world.  
We got to get away, oh oh  
Get away from the world

Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse  
But umm, some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?  
  
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole  
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold  
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls  
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?  
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride, I ain't that old  
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??  
It probably don't seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle  
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you  
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you  
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you  
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you  
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?  
  
[Chorus:]  
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you  
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you  
If you got love for me, I still got love for you  
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you  
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you  
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you  
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you  
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth  
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth  
I'm speakin' the known truth  
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof  
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?  
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?  
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right  
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites  
I ain't blind from the limelite,  
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right  
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful  
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed  
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler  
One million customers, and I still bust at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?  
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few ?? and met a few locs  
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes  
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz  
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds?  
It's strange, what the fame'll do  
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the same nigga man  
Same nigga, that ridin' with you  
Niggas that's fuckin' with you  
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas  
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like  
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy  
Don't let this game change you nigga...

Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right

Twice for the Son  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
  
Come on in, the water's warm  
Come on like I sugared you, but with a kick in the head  
Like putting wings on lead  
Your eyes are black in my starlight  
I'm the last of my kind  
(And as always I'm not addicted to you)  
  
Follow the disorganized religion of my head  
And we'll never get through customs  
Let's just take off again instead  
  
Got my degree in the gutter  
My heart broken in the dorms of the Ivy League

Garth Brooks,/g/garth+brooks/the+fever_20058008.html,The Fever,"He's got a split finger wrap  
And his rope's pulled way too tight  
He's got a lunatic smile  
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight  
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight  
  
He takes one last breath  
And time turns inside out  
Then the gate busts open  
To the world he dreams about  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Stick a rope on anything ?cause he don't care  
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight  
  
He says it's really kind of simple  
Keep your mind in the middle  
While your butt spins 'round and 'round  
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'  
Keep liftin' and reachin'  
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns  
  
What he loves might kill him  
But he's got no choice  
He's a different breed  
With a voice down deep inside  
That's screamin' he was born to ride  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense  
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense  
But he won't run and baby he can't hide  
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied  
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight  
I know you think he's crazy, well I think you're right  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there  
That's right!

Sacrifice reason for shame  
  
I won't ask for  
Faith or forgiveness

In the night  
I'll be a vampire calling  
In the dead of night  
  
I'll be your demon  
Shadow man  
I'll be your one confession  
  
And if I can  
I'll be your nightmare  
And scream for you  
I'll be your one possession  
If you want me to  
  
I'll be your secret

I'll be your exhibition of atrocity

Lift up their eyes while they pray  
  
When children kill children  
Don't it make them wonder?  
Don't it make them question their faith?

How I survived God only knows  
I don't like the memory  
How I survived God only knows  
How I survived God only knows  
  
I remember the feeling  
I'll remember forever

I don't believe in a God  
Now I question everything  
  
The dreamer is gone  
I'm an old man  
  
I could tell you of horror  
I could show you the pieces  
But I just want to forget

They gaze at the scenery  
They act as if it is perfectly clear  
Take a look at the mountains  
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood

I fight to rise from this river of hell  
I stare round about me  
Children are swimming  
And playing with their boats  
Their features are changing  
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone

Fang's frantic paws told the tale of his sin.  
Far off the chase shrieked revenge.  
  
Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread,  
The last sacred haunt of the dead.  
He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know,  
The sceptre and crown of the king.  
Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack,  
Plunging through forests and snow-storm.  
  
Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky,  
Fang sped through the jungles of ice.  
Hard on his tale, One-eye drew from the pack  
An old hero conquered by none.  
  
Steep, for too steep grew the pathway ahead  
Descent was the only escape  
A wolf never flees in the face of his foe  
Fang knew the price he would pay  
One-eye stood before him  
With the crown upon his head  
Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow.  
  
Fang, son of great Fang, the Traitor we seek,  
The laws of the Brethren say this  
That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods  
And he, the Usurper must die  
  
Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe  
But Fang fought the hero in vain  
Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red  
Never would the crown leave again  
One-eye hid the crown and with laurels on his head  
Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace.

Than the hurtin' you're puttin' me through

Beggars watch and eat their meal -- from garbage cans

Killing plauges the citizens  
Unless they own police  
  
Children play with rusted cars  
Sores cover their hands  
Politicians laugh ad drink -- drunk to all demands

Infected by the grief

Glad for what we have

Your eyes tell more than you mean them to  
Lit up and flashin like the reds and blues  
Out there on the neon avenue  
Well I, feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
  
Well the musics thunderin, restless and hot  
You keep firin me glances across the room  
And I can't stop wonderin just what you got  
Get the feeling I'm going to find out real soon  
But I feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
So lets get on with the show, lets go  
  
Yes, and the wheels its smokin round midnight  
You show me a look that says lets go  
Yes, and it feels about like running a red light  
Now there aint no point in looking behind us, no!  
Still I feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
You know its gonna get stranger, lets get on with the show  
  
If this were love now how would I know? How would I know?  
Feel like a stranger  
Gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night  
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night

Before he speaks the world around us quiets.  
With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire  
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather.  
Many in a circle slowly 'round the fire  
When he is gone I want to know him better.  
No one is forsaken, no one is a liar,  
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water.  
He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns,  
We are singing and playing, I her him saying.  
I remember breezes from winds inside your body  
Keep me high, like I told you, I'll sing to them this story and know why

I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy  
When he was young did he have dreams  
Of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy?  
  
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age  
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change  
  
Or will I grow that old?  
Will I still be around?  
The way I carry on I'll end up  
Six feet underground  
And waste away...  
  
When the old man was in school  
Did the golden rule make him go crazy  
Or did he hide away from hopes  
Behind a smile and smoking dope  
It's crazy  
  
It seems so frightening  
Time passes by like lightning  
Before you know it you're struck down  
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions  
It keeps my head spinning around.

On the border line of the edge

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive

From the trestle you could hear the weirdest moans  
With a mighty lonesome cry came a whistle from the sky  
And it chilled the very marrow in my bones  
  
Then a loud rushing roar like you never heard before  
Turned the blood to icy water in my veins  
As I watched with rising fear something strange was drawing near  
And I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
  
(Ghost trains ghost trains what a fearful sight)  
The Cannonball and No 9 were racing through the night  
Just as they passed me by I heard the engineer cry  
Giver her coal give her coal shovel it on  
  
You could see the fireman grinnin' in the engine that was winnin'  
But I knew before the finish they'd be gone  
(Well he knew before the finish they'd be gone)  
You could see the drivers roll as they shoveled on the coal  
  
And the black smoke came pouring from the stacks  
As they thundered through the sky I am here to testify  
You could hear the wheel a clickin' on the tracks  
Through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam  
  
Now I have no proof but still the fact remains  
You may doubt it but I swear there were cinders in my hair  
When I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
(Ghost trains ghost trains...  
  
As I watched I saw them fade into the dawn  
(As he watched he saw them fade into the dawn)

You want me yet there's something else before me in your heart  
You're wanting me to change my life the way you're living yours  
But I can't change I see no way you wanted me before  
  
If you don't want me like I am then please don't pity me  
If you can't change a little bit then why not set me free  
If we can't live together then it's best we live apart  
You'll go your way and I'll go mine we'll both make brand new start  
  
There's nothing we can do it seems we'll never get along  
With you believing like you do you say I live so wrong  
But I can't change my way of life I lived it much too long  
You either take me like I am or I'll go on alone  
  
So either say you want my love or take the way you live  
Remember though before you get you got to learn to give  
So if it change my life or go then go it's goin' be  
Cause I can't change my life when you want something more than me

But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train.  
I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me.  
All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name.  
  
I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter,  
That said ""I don't love him. I'm leaving this cold mean man.""  
As the train pulled away from the platform  
And I put her in the wagon,  
With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man.  
  
And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin.  
In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame.  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.  
  
Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion.  
His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy.  
""One way or another,"" he said,  
""partner, I'm taking back my woman.""  
With my hand on my gun, I said, ""Don't bet your life.  
The lady says she's staying with me.""  
His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern  
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor.  
He was a dead man, but I have been too since I lost her.  
From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door.  
  
But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin.

High up in the sky  
  
And every moment extends endlessly

And every second, one breath not to breathe

And slowly he moves, but so elegantly

Some are long and some small  
But all of them tall  
Everyone must make a choice

The evil one behind me  
I hear his breath and turn around  
There's no place left to hide here  
  
Wanna break the chains of fear  
There's no way back  
Your whisper in my ear  
Your touch will save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
I've lost my soul in the game he plays  
No doubt that he won't spare me  
Hunting me, trapped in his chase  
Subject to violation  
  
I'm afraid to fall asleep  
Whether day and night  
But once I'm there in my dreams  
You'll come to save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white

Independence Day,/i/independence+day/battle+of+new+orleans_20795058.html,Battle Of New Orleans,"Well, in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip  
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.  
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,  
And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, I see'd Mars Jackson walkin down the street  
Talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafayette [pronounced La-feet]  
He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee  
And the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea.  
  
The French said Andrew, you'd better run,  
For Packingham's a comin' with a bullet in his gun.  
Old Hickory said he didn't give a dang,  
He's gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Packingham.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, we looked down the river and we see'd the British come,  
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum.  
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring  
While we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  
  
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise  
If we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes.  
We held our fire til we see'd their faces well,  
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, we fired our cannon til the barrel melted down,  
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.  
We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind,  
And when they tetched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.  
  
We'll march back home but we'll never be content  
Till we make Old Hickory the people's President.  
And every time we think about the bacon and the beans,  
We'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin,  
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles  
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.  
They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch 'em  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.

We shall fight over the seas and oceans.  
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.

We shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds,  
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets,  
We shall fight on the hills.  
We shall never surrender.

Into the eyes of the night-watching me go  
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple  
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?  
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.  
And in my last hour,  
I'm a slave to the power of death.  
  
When I was living this lie-fear was my game  
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,  
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.

Iron Maiden,/i/iron+maiden/quest+for+fire_20068032.html,Quest For Fire,"In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam.  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.

I shall return from out of fire.  
  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

Price for failure of your will

'Cause we're all the junkies who never can win

Make a cut by fire and stones,  
Take you and your blade and break you both

Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

Depan pasar dekat terminal

Melihat mayat yang membusuk  
Tutup hidung sesekali meludah  
Aku lihat orang menangis  
Disela gaduhnya suasana  
Segera aku menghampiri  
Dengan bimbang ku bertanya padanya  
Rupanya yang mati sang teman  
Teman hitam hidup sepaham  
Hanya kisah yang dilewati  
Ia berdua ikat tali saudara  
Sementara surya mulai tinggi  
Panas terasa bakar kepala  
Sisa darah orang yang mati  
Disimpannya didalam hati  
Lalu dia seperti batu  
Sampai malam sampai semuanya pergi

Ada lagi orang yang mati

Dijantung hari-hari . . . . . . .

With a broken down heart in despair

Put back all the pieces and made me home  
I was living in the past, oh no  
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back

But the dreams of a boy disappear when you're grown  
And though I may dream, the railroads are gone  
The ties they are rotten  
And the tracks shot to hell  
Along with my dreams and the old railroad bell  
  
In my dreams I ride the rails to California  
Workin' diners and farms along the way  
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border  
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way  
  
Now the mountains are silent  
And the railroads are gone  
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn  
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me

And when he lays his hands upon the ponies  
They shudder with an understanding skin  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
When the storm clouds in the west  
Are quickly gathering  
The ponies they run wild there  
Before it rains  
  
You'll see their sleek dark bodies  
Brightly gleaming  
You know the fire is flying through  
Their brains  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away

I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day

And boy it was a good one  
So she chased after her dream  
With much desire  
But when she got too close  
To her expectations  
Well the dream burned up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
He wanted love  
With no involvement  
So he chased the wind  
That's all his silly life required  
And the days of vanity  
Went on forever  
And he saw his days burn up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
There's a good life  
Right across this green field  
And each generation  
Stares at it from afar  
But we keep no check  
On our appetites  
So the green fields turn to brown  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin' down the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?

upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
plowin through the ragid skies and up a cloudy draw  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
for he saw the riders comin hard and he heard their mournful cries  
  
chorus:

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred  
their shirts all soaked with sweat  
he's ridin hard to catch that herd  
but he ain't caught em yet  
cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
''if you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range

Mutts of the planet  
And shook me down for alibis  
I'm waiting  
For the keeper to release me  
Debating this sentence  
Biding my time

Burning up the bandstand

To my cold hard cash!

Going by  
  
There are things I wish I'd done  
Some friends I'm gonna miss  
Beautiful lovers  
I never got the chance to kiss  
  
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living  
Processions of missing  
Lovers and friends  
Fade in and they fade out again  
In these daydreams of rebirth  
I see myself in style  
Raking in what I'm worth  
Next time

I've known you all summer and you rose above it all  
I see you hesitate to fall now  
But it's a pretty good view from down here too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go, I will let go too  
  
I knew you when you were green and small  
Like a feather on a wing, so long  
You know I will miss you when you are gone  
But don't be afraid if you just can't hang on  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go, I will let go too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go, I will let go too  
  
The cold air is pushing hard on you  
I know what you're saying, I can feel it too  
You'll go through changes and I'll go through them too  
Don't be afraid now, no don't be afraid, don't be afraid  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go, I will let go too

I took the blame.  
Directionless so plain to see,  
A loaded gun won't set you free.  
So you say.  
  
We'll share a drink and step outside,  
An angry voice and one who cried,  
'We'll give you everything and more,  
The strain's too much, can't take much more.'  
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire,  
Can't seem to feel it anymore.

Hoping for something more,  
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else.

The energy would rise  
And through the heat I'd gaze  
Still counting empty days  
With fire in my eyes

Can I break this spell

I heard your body talk  
I saw a shooting star  
In some magnetic trance  
Our beating hearts would dance  
And crash down from afar  
Oh how strange fate is  
Never dreamed of this

From whom all things proceed  
To whom all things return  
Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun  
Hidden by a disk of golden light  
That we may know the truth  
And do our whole duty  
As we journey to thy sacred feet  
  
Well I said  
""Lily, Oh Lily I don't feel safe  
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me""

""Child, you must protect yourself  
I'll show you how with fire""

Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire

I fear I am walking in the Veil of Darkness""

With a pinch of salt  
And protect yourself with fire""

Kate Bush,/k/kate+bush/never+be+mine_20077265.html,Never Be Mine,"I look at you and see  
My life that might have been  
Your face just ghostly in the smoke.  
They're setting fire to the cornfields  
As you're taking me home.  
The smell of burning fields  
Will now mean you and here.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
The thrill and the hurting  
I know that this will never be mine.  
  
I want you as the dream  
Not the reality  
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me  
But I'm looking back over my shoulder  
At you, happy without me.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.  
The thrill and the hurting  
It will never be mine.  
It can never be  
The thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.

Kate Bush,/k/kate+bush/rockets+tail_20077267.html,Rocket's Tail,"That Novenber night, looking up into the sky.  
You said ""Hey wish that was me up there  
It's the biggest rocket I could find  
And it's holding the night in its arms  
If for only a moment.  
I can't see the look in its eyes  
But I'm sure it must be laughing.""  
But it seemed to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen  
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing.  
  
I saw only a stick on fire  
Alone on its journey  
Home to the quickening ground  
With no one there to catch it.  
  
I put on my pointed hat  
And my black and silver suit  
And I check my gunpowder pack  
And I strap the stick on my back  
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge  
Nobody seemed to see me  
Then with the fuse in my hand  
And now shooting into the night  
And still as a rocket  
I land in the river.  
  
Was it me said you were crazy?  
I put on my cloudiest suit  
Size 5 lightening boots too  
'Coz I am a rocket  
On fire  
Look at me go with my tail on fire  
With my tail on fire  
On fire  
Hey, look at me go, look at me

Keith Urban,/k/keith+urban/ghost+in+this+guitar_20621515.html,Ghost In This Guitar,"Down the drain pipe cross the yard and through the fence  
I risked a whoopin' every time I went  
'Cause white boys weren't allowed  
On the colored side of town  
But I was proud to call  
That old black man my friend  
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on  
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on  
I knew where my fingers went  
From his greasy fingerprints  
Yeah, he was passin' on  
What was handed down to him  
  
[Chorus]  
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops  
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars  
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands  
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart  
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar  
A ghost in this guitar  
  
Well, the night before he died he made me take it  
He said, ""You play it now, 'cause I gotta go""  
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it  
'Cause sometimes I'm in control  
And sometimes I just sit back  
And let him go  
Sit back and let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a listen to the ghost in this guitar

Keith Urban,/k/keith+urban/used+to+the+pain_20356593.html,Used To The Pain,"And so I wrote this song for you  
I think I know just what you're going through  
Did you believe you'd never change?  
Nothin' ever stays the same  
  
I know it's hard holdin' on  
Even harder trying to let it go  
And so you're frozen like a stone  
But you are not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Every step I take  
I get a little less afraid  
Of giving in to love, love  
Let it out  
Believe me when I say  
It gets better every day  
Once you get used to the pain  
  
What you hide inside I see  
There's a scar that's always gonna be  
There's a past in everyone  
You can't undo  
You can't outrun  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Once you get used to the pain

Kelly Clarkson,/k/kelly+clarkson/breakaway_10156534.html,Breakaway,"Grew up in a small town  
And when the rain would fall down  
I'd just stare out my window  
Dreamin' of what could be  
And if I'd end up happy  
I would pray  
  
Trying hard to reach out  
But when I tried to speak out  
Felt like no one could hear me  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray  
I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And I'll make a wish  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love  
I'll take a risk  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Want to feel the warm breeze  
Sleep under a palm tree  
Feel the rush of the ocean  
Get on board a fast train  
Travel on a jet plane  
Faraway  
And breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
I won't forget all the ones that I love  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors  
Swinging 'round revolvin' doors  
Maybe I don't know where they take me  
But gotta keep movin' on  
Movin' on  
Fly away  
Breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I won't forget the place I come from  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

And so you fight to keep from pouring out  
But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secret soul  
Do you think that there's enough you might drown?  
  
[Chorus]  
If no one will listen  
If you decide to speak  
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode  
If no one wants to look at you  
For what you really are  
I will be here still  
  
No one can take you where you alone must go  
There's no telling what you will find there  
And, God, I know the fear that eats away at your bones  
It's screaming every step, ""Just stay here?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down  
If your legs have given out under the weight  
If you find you've been settling for a world of gray  
So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I will be here still

I couldn't even see his face.  
I couldn't see his face.  
He was holding a gun in his hand.  
Umm, I was thinking  
This is a dangerous place  
This is a dangerous place  
  
I said, ""I'm nervous as hell from this stuff.  
I thought those guys were going to kill me for sure.  
They ganged up on me like that.  
I couldn't believe it.  
Look, I'm still shakin'.  
Weird.  
There out in the streets like that.  
It's a dangerous place.  
It's a dangerous place.""  
  
So, suddenly, these two guys appear in front of me.  
They stopped.  
Real aggressive.  
Start at me, you know.  
""What's that?"" ""What's that on that tape?""  
What do you got there?""  
I said, ""huh?""  
They said, ""What are you talking into that for?""  
I said, ""It's just a tape, you know""  
""Well play it for me""  
I said ""oh, no""  
I put it off as long as I could.  
And finally they turned it on, you know  
They grabbed it from me.  
Took it away from me.  
Turned it on.  
And it said, ""He held a gun in his hand. This is a dangerous place.""  
They said, ""What dangerous place?"" ""What gun?"" ""You're a policeman!""  
And the deeper I talked, the worse I got into it.  
I talked, I told him, I said, ""Look man, I'm not talkin'""  
It went on forever.  
Anyway, I finally unbuttoned my shirt, and said,  
""look, look, I'm in this band, you know, I'm in this band you know,  
and we're makin' a recording, you know.  
It's about New York City, it's about crime in the streets.  
""The explanation was going nowhere, but,  
Finally, they just kinda let me go, I don't know why.  
So I walk around the corner,  
and I'm like shakin' like a leaf,  
and I thought, ""This is a dangerous place""  
  
Who should appear, but two policeman.

King Diamond,/k/king+diamond/a+broken+spell_20078742.html,A Broken Spell,"I stumbled out of Grandma's room,  
Down the stairs and out of the house  
Once outside I felt My mind begin to  
Fight a battle for control  
  
With the tea pot broken I kind of  
Realized  
That ""THEIR"" power was less here,  
Here on the outside  
  
I fell to my knees in haziness  
And I looked in through the window  
To the cellar  
  
Things were moving down there,  
""THEY"" were searching for something  
And ""THEY"" really found it,  
The big axe was flying  
  
Flying out through the cellar door  
Up the stairs to the kitchen...  
Then I passed out  
  
The next thing I remember seeing was  
The smoke coming from the chimney  
I soon realized the smoke I saw was  
Actually... Oh No!  
All there was left of Missy and her  
Dress, poor little girl  
  
The spell was broken, I really felt the  
Change  
As my mind and body became one  
Again  
  
The moon was alive with its silvery  
Eye  
Staring right into My evil heart  
  
I went back to see if My Grandma'  
Was still there  
Waiting for me in the attic  
Oh I hate that bitch

Later that Night in her Room, Abigail was drifting off to sleep.  
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail was quickly on her feet  
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound  
And there she was: the child  
  
It was clearly a ghost, the ghost from the gate in the storm  
""Little girl, tell me who you are?""  
""I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm little one""  
  
That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six  
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did  
  
Hiding in the dark, listening to the men  
Tell their stories from way back then  
She remembered the story of Jonathan  
  
And they'd been talking about the Little One  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail she knew she had to stay  
Saving Little One and breaking the chain, breaking the chain

My horse was getting tired, and so was I  
Up there the moon was full, down here darkness ruled  
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to  
  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
I used to know this road so well, many a time i was here before  
  
But now it seemed so different, the road was no more  
I was lost, I stopped and looked around  
I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
  
I knew I was not alone, and it wasn't not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
Watching me  
The trees have eyes, watching me  
  
Then the sound I didn't want to hear, howling at the moon  
Eyes I didn't want to see, I should have turned around  
So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones  
One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone  
  
Yellow eyes, they were everywhere, yellow eyes, as I prepared to die  
Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light  
Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white  
The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine  
  
Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes

Kinks,/k/kinks/cricket_20079075.html,Cricket,"Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so  
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.  
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket  
It has honor, it has character and it's British.  
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments  
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.  
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all  
And come to God's call with bat and ball.  
  
Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,  
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.  
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket  
And you know that that's not cricket.  
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin  
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.  
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.  
  
All through your life he'll try to bowl you out  
Beware the Demon bowler.  
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,  
And bowl a maiden over.  
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous  
And remember that God is on your side.  
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

By the dawn's early light,  
What so proudly we hailed,  
At the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,  
Through the perilous fight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched,  
Were so gallantly streaming.  
And the rocket's red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night,  
That our flag was still there.  
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave,  
For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

On endless scraps of paper  
Years of hanging round  
A life of wasted labor  
And it's still the same old night

And this darkness blinds my eyes

And haunt me once again  
Watch my life unfold  
And see the shape it's taking  
Watch my fingers write  
And see the way they're shaking

In the things that you never seemed to say?  
How many times have I read those last lines  
And wondered why it ended this way?  
Words of goodbye and all those loving lines  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
How you would write about the bright lights  
And your words always clouded up my eyes  
How you would write about the bright lights  
It's a wonder that I never realized  
Our race was run now and another's just begun  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they came in the flood of memories  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they ran like the rivers to the seas  
Each sunny day, you slip further away  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time

I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now I'm a stranger  
To a strange land I'm driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
Or the name I am calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So weep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him

Do not steal police hate competition  
Where we gonna run, where we gonna hide?  
You've got the right to remain silent  
But forever they were brought here to protect us  
They were brought here not to hurt  
But now they hurt us everyday  
You see, police have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down, something must be done  
Catching the bad guys in real life  
Is not as easy as it is in the movies  
We see James Bond  
(007)  
Eddie Murphy  
(Beverly Hills Cop)  
Chasing bad guys all the time  
But police in real life have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down something must be done  
Our life has got to be like  
Life in the movies  
Where the good guys always  
Win in the end  
Life in the movies  
How can we expect them  
To serve and protect the community?  
If they themselves are the bad guys  
Police have joined forces with criminals  
Stand up and fight, no one is safe  
Life in the movies  
Life in the movies

Birds used to fly around here  
But now it is a different jungle  
A concrete jungle

It's all defined  
There's nothing you can tell me now

Like her dying on my windshield, I can already feel her worms eating my spine  
So how can it be this lonely?  
Is this all we get for our lives? Is love only sweeter when one of us dies?  
  
Then I knew that our love was just a car crash away

Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""  
  
Thou givest fever when we kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm afire  
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, ""Daddy, oh, don't you dare""  
  
""He gives me fever with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right"", go  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears

I see a rainbow all in black  
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back  
Wake up at night callin' your name  
I see a face on my window pane  
  
I've been this way since you've been gone  
Without your love I can't go on  
Look in the mirror, what do I see?  
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me  
Now where's the love you promised me?  
Where's he tenderness to comfort me?  
  
Everytime some love I choose  
I seem to always be the one to lose  
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad  
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad  
  
Black crows flying up above  
It's a sign that I live life without love  
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea  
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be  
  
And this world where nothing's right  
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night  
You said you'd be true to me  
Instead you made a fool out of me

Rolling the call of ""Come now to war.""  
  
Throughout the night they fashioned their might  
With right on the side of the mighty.  
They puzzled their minds plan upon plan  
Man upon man  
And at dying of dawn the great war began.  
  
They met on the battlefield banner in hand.  
They looked out across the vacant land.  
And they counted the missing, one upon one,  
None upon none.

They gave a war and nobody came.  
And nobody came.

Neil Diamond,/n/neil+diamond/i+am+the+lion_20256521.html,I Am The Lion,"There was a flood and many poor men were killed.  
And that is why our house is built on the top of a hill.  
The plains are like a friend, why can't we live on them?  
And if a flood should come, why can't we run?  
  
I am the lion, bellowing out in the night.  
We had a cow, I left it alone to graze.  
And walked to the stream and when I returned, it was stolen away.  
But now the cow is gone and we don't need a farm.  
  
We have not one thing they  
Would steal away.  
  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am... the lion.

You never get inside my head.

We play hide and seek  
So many things are left unsaid.  
  
Why can't you see  
What's on the other side of me,  
The side of me that reaches out to you.  
Sweet thoughts and dreams,  
Like drops of rain on rippling streams  
That wind and bend,  
Rivers with no end,  
Flowing on the other side of me.  
  
It seems I always get unstrung  
I trip on my tongue  
With words that come out something else.  
I'm so afraid the things I say  
Might chase you away,  
I have to hide behind myself.  
  
Why can't you see  
What's on the other side of me,  
The side of me that reaches out to you.  
Why must I hide  
These feelings that have been denied.  
Only you can set me free  
See what's on the other side of me.

Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow

Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite

Waitin' for a train  
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk  
Sleepin' in the rain

And they hide their eyes  
'Cause the city's dyin'

Man, it's hard just to live, just to live  
  
Get my sister Sandy  
And my little brother Ray  
Buy a big old wagon  
Gonna haul us all away  
  
Livin' in the country  
Where the mountain's high  
Never comin' back here  
'Til the day I die

Never saw inside my head  
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand  
Never heard a thing I said  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I've been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' I enjoy

Give your love and it will come to you

Could escape and hold the key  
To a paradise that's true and free

Steal away, steal away  
Steal away--the night  
You gotta steal it  
C'mon baby  
  
Now I've met your honesty  
You are here and I am free  
Broken chains have fallen all around  
Point my finger at the fools  
Broken chains and broken rules  
Let it be rebellion rules tonite

Steal away, you gotta steal away  
Steal away--the night

Can it be a dream come true  
Now that I am here with you  
Tearful eyes of joy is something new  
Runaway with me tonight  
Dream the dream and light the light  
Happiness is what you give to me  
Oooooh yeah!!

Away  
The face of the doomsday  
Clock  
Has launched a thousand wars  
As we near the final hour  
Time is the only foe we have  
  
When war is obsolete  
I'll thank god for the war's  
To end  
But any talk about hell  
Freezing over  
Is all said with tongue in cheek  
Until the day the war drums  
Beat no more  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb

Alone without the misery  
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp

Hiding from the laughter  
And the demons dancing round my brain  
Always dancing on thin ice

That little laugh of yours doesn't hide the tension  
The precious book you clutch so tightly in your hands

You ask advice, then resent my observations  
If I didn't care, then I wouldn't make them  
Can't change the past, so why let it haunt you  
Can paint the future, but first you have to want to  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend

In a doorway  
By the bodegas and the lights on  
Upper Broadway  
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes

Emerging from a dream, the dream returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
  
After the rain on the Interstate  
Headlights slide past the moon  
A bone-weary traveler that  
Waits by the side of the road  
Where's he going?  
  
In a dream we are lying on the top of a hill  
And headlights slide past the moon  
I roll in your arms  
And your voice is the heat of the night  
I'm on fire  
  
In a phone booth  
In some local bar and grill  
Rehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns

For the others to fire  
And you sit back and watch  
While the death toll gets higher  
You hide in your mansion  
While young people's blood  
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud  
You've thrown the worst fear  
That could ever be hurled  
The fear to bring children  
Into this world

You ain't worth the blood that runs through your veins

You might say we're unlearned  
But there's one thing I know  
Though I'm younger than you

Let me ask you one question  
Is your money that good?  
Will it buy you forgiveness?  
Do you think that it would?  
Oh, I think you will find  
When your death takes its toll  
All the money you made will never buy back your soul  
And I hope that you die  
And your death will come soon  
I'll stand on your [Incomprehensible]  
In the pale afternoon  
And I'll watch while you're lowered  
Into your deathbed  
And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that you're dead

And near a river down a lonely winding road  
Friendly conversation  
Then you read by candlelight  
  
Every word of every story told  
Maybe you can move into the castle  
Surrounded by the ivy covered walls  
Find a bit of paradise  
  
Where no one bothers you  
Only time they come is when you call  
  
Something I never realized about the city  
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
It's been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may seem funny  
You can hide if you want, you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look, everyone I see  
Everywhere it's all the same

That I alone could win or lose it

Divided in two, like Adam and Eve

With no guilt and no shame, no sorrow or blame  
Whatever it is, we are all the same  
  
Making it up in our secret world [x3]  
Shaking it up

On a wing on a prayer

Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'ma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire.  
  
[Verse 2]  
And people like to laugh at you cause they  
Are all the same.  
See I would rather we just go our different way,  
Than play the game.  
And no matter the weather, we can do it better,  
You and me together forever and ever.  
We don't have to worry about a thing,  
About a thing

I been down to my last match  
Felt a hundred different demons  
Breathing fire in my back  
And I knew that if I stumbled  
I'd fall right into the trap that they were laying, Yeah  
  
But the good news  
Is there's angels everywhere out on the street  
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet  
The one's that you been dragging for so long  
You're on your knees  
You might as well be praying  
Guess what I'm saying  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Yeah, If you're going through hell  
Keep on moving, Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out

Springing from the weight  
Of the mountains  
Like the heart of the earth  
Would burst  
Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst  
  
Something swam through  
The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence  
When the water takes you home  
I hear the wordless voices  
When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...

Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
On the eve of destruction  
A reign of terror rules the street  
When the heads start rolling  
The devil comes to let it bleed  
  
In the city of angels  
Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Walk on past the alien nation  
Walk on to the end of your reach  
No fear of the alien nation  
No fear of the hatred they preach  
  
Don't run, there's no place to hide  
Today or tomorrow it will get you  
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat  
And whatever you do, there's no way out  
  
When the shroud comes down on this place  
To bury us all alive  
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
Walk on past the alien nation

They pray for eternal damnation  
They pray for your soul to keep

Half the time we're trying  
Trying hard what a fool  
Saying anything to raze it all  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die

Keeping on with the flow  
Giving everybody such a show  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again I'm riding high  
Worried 'bout anything that passes by  
It's not a nightmare or a dream  
It's not the first time that it's been

Watching my back again or I could die

What is going on  
So you'd best not freak out  
Lose your mind lose your cool

You thought you had known me before  
I brought you a crate of papaya  
They waited all night by your door  
You probably wouldn't remember  
I probably couldn't forget  
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain  
Everything's better when wet  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
  
But lately you live in the jungle  
I never see you alone  
But we need some definite answers  
So I thought I would write you a poem  
The question to everyone's answer  
Is usually asked from within  
But the patterns of the rain  
And the truth they contain  
Have written my life on your skin  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
  
You treat me like I was your ocean  
You swim in my blood when it's warm  
My cycles of circular motion  
Protect you and keep you from harm  
You live in a world of illusion  
Where everything's peaches and cream  
We all face a scarlet conclusion  
But we spend our time in a dream  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad

Supertramp,/s/supertramp/from+now+on_20133909.html,From Now On,"Monday has come around again  
I'm in the same old place  
With the same old faces always watching me  
Who knows how long I'll have to stay  
Could be a hundred years  
Of sweat and tears  
At the rate that I get paid  
  
Sometimes I slowly drift away  
From all the dull routine  
That's with me every day  
A fantasy will come to me  
Diamonds are what I really need  
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law  
And live in Italy  
  
Lately my luck has been so bad  
You know the roulette wheel's  
A crooked deal  
I'm losing all I had  
  
Soon be like a man that's on the run  
And live from day to day  
Never needing anyone  
Play hide and seek  
Throughout the week  
  
My life is full of romance  
  
Guess I'll always have to be  
Living in a fantasy  
That's the way it's got to be  
From now on  
You think I'm crazy I can see  
It's you for you, and me for me  
Living in a fantasy  
From now on

In deep concern for one young woman that's where I abide today  
Today I got a dear-John-letter from that young woman in the USA  
  
When I was called I knew I'd lose her it don't matter anyway  
There are girls in Saigon City waiting there with open arms  
On my leave I may go see them in this other world called VietNam  
  
Stateside girls should take this warning be faithful cause you can't tell  
On the streets of Saigon City they have many things to sell  
There are girls in Saigon City...

If you go near the lake  
Keep your eyes wide open  
And look for sneaky snake  
  
Now, maybe you won't see him  
And maybe you won't hear  
But he'll sneak up behind you  
And drink all your root beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass  
It tickles his underneath  
  
Well sneaky snake drinks root beer  
And he just makes me sick  
When he is not dancing  
He looks just like stick  
  
Now he doesn't have any arms or legs  
You cannot see his ears  
And while we are not looking  
He's stealing all of our beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass

Tori Amos,/t/tori+amos/glory+of+the+80s_20139541.html,Glory Of The 80's,"I took a taxi form LA to Venus  
In 1985 I was electromagnetically sucked  
Back into a party going on that night  
It was the gory of the 80s with karma drawn up in lines  
And two Bugle Boy models saying ""baby it's a freebie  
You sure look deprived."" I had the  
Story of O in my bucket seat  
Of my want to be mustang  
Auditioning for reptiles in their  
Raquel Welsh campaign  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
""I'm not afraid to die"" I said  
I don't find that remotely funny, even  
On this space cake high  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Silicone party babies to the left  
And Joan of Arcs to the right  
No one feeling insecure  
We were all gorge and famous in our last lives  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
""the end is nothing to fear"" I said  
Blow the end  
Now baby who do I gotta shag to get outta here  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Sure you're out there orbiting around  
Wish I had you back now  
I met a drag king called venus  
She had a velvet hologram she said  
""My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am""  
In the glories of the 80's  
I may not have to die  
I'll clone myself like that blonde chick  
That sings Bette Davis eyes and then  
When it all seemed to clear  
Just then  
You go and disappear

Tell me now baby is he good to you  
Can he do to you the things that I do  
I can take you higher  
I'm on fire  
  
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby  
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley  
through the middle of my soul  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
and a freight train running through the  
middle of my head  
Only you can cool my desire

No rhyme or reason

Alone with voices in your mind  
You see the world in black and white  
You know until you see the light  
There ain't no end, no end in sight  
  
I can't justify  
The cleansing of society  
The human race  
It ain't no race at all  
I breach the flood  
Of political insanity  
Where hope once stood  
Is filled with lies and shame

Alive or dead or just reborn  
One day before Easter comes

I won't let him lift me up  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
If Jesus comes around again  
  
I'll cry I'll cry  
I'll cry for help  
I'll let you be the one  
To try to redeem the sins of man  
One day before Easter comes  
But I won't let Jesus find me  
  
I'm gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but not the sin  
I'm gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but no the sin  
If Jesus comes around again  
I've got the rock the needle  
The bottle of sorrow  
And Jesus Jesus Jesus knows

Our warm breath fading in the air  
I'm not sure why I tell you, still less what I mean  
It's like a dream and maybe there's no cause  
But in the end it's  
What you can give to someone  
How you can help to set them free

Big world we've got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right

Get us through the night  
This world is wounded now and we inflict  
The pain  
We have to change our lives and think again  
'Cause in the end it's  
All that we're sure we're made of  
All that we know to set us free
