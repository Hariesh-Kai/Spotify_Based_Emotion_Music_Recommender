America,/a/america/slow+down_20007129.html,Slow Down,"I hear you knockin' but you can't come in  
You wear your stockings like you think it's a sin  
Don't try to tell me you ain't been where you been  
'Cause I know that you've been messin' round with him  
So slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Come on down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Oh down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
I met you dancin' at the high school gym  
You rubbed against me my head started to spin  
You turned around gave me a wink and a grin  
And then you told me that you'd like to be friends  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
Take it!  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't try to tell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
You'll never sell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
I said before it gets too late  
You know before it gets too late  
Oh, hey

Bing Crosby,/b/bing+crosby/ill+be+home+for+christmas_20528333.html,I'll Be Home For Christmas,"I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams

If only in my dreams

Britney Spears,/b/britney+spears/rebellion_20526391.html,Rebellion,"You might not believe it  
But trust me this is true  
You fall for their poison  
And become a part of their crew  
I'm in a rebellion  
And I'm up against the truth  
So will you join me?  
Or will you be taken too?  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
Your body starts breaking in  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
Be wary of others  
The ones closest to you  
The poison they feed you  
And the voodoo that they do  
But in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth  
Don't just stand there  
Do what you got to do  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
With everyone yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
The eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in  
I'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin  
But in rebellion there's a glimmer of light  
And nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion

Cat Stevens,/c/cat+stevens/another+saturday+night_20028203.html,Another Saturday Night,"[Chorus: ]  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
I've seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  
But as yet I haven't met 'em  
That's how I'm in the state I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat named Frankenstein  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend my money  
I'm gonna have to blow this town  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid

Changing their names  
Pulling tricks  
Getting their kicks  
All the way down

Meeting the stars  
In funky bars  
Shiny new cars  
And back door lies  
Trying to hike  
Or any other type of ride  
All the way down

Try these here flakes  
They got what it takes  
To make you a star  
And change who you are  
All the way down  
Let it ride  
  
Tell me were you satisfied?  
Did you mix it?  
Did you like it?  
Oh! tell me was it good to you  
I wanna know did you make enough money?  
Did you make enough money to go down in style?  
Or did you find yourself just dying  
Dying, dying, dying, after a while?  
  
Got to get off!  
Got to get off!  
I got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get off!  
Please help me, help me!  
To git off now, now!  
Before I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees  
And lose my key to freedom

With a horse of different forces  
Lying wings of films  
That seem to never see the screen

Down and out  
Couldn't bear to shout it out  
  
Brought up on the road  
A sparkle shiny diner  
Is the home for wayward minor  
In a flying car that seems  
To whisper in an ear  
Lets just go get out of here

All hands to the knife  
  
And I can hear the screams  
With the knife, the jolt, the wring  
They must follow in our dreams  
Carrying a twisted sting  
  
Children's stories with their farmyard favourites  
At the table in a different disguise  
  
Don't talk to me of health  
Or something someone else will do  
We're talking about the act  
Of taking life for me and you

Judas Priest,/j/judas+priest/white+heat+red+hot_20076245.html,White Heat Red Hot,"The father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy,  
Deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary.  
Lead us all into arena, magnificent in death.  
Well let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step.  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy,  
An overture forever more to senseless victories.  
Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill  
So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The heat's hot burns a lot.  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.  
  
Prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill  
To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill.  
The centuries of dedication inherited till at last  
From years of solar gladiation can only end in  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The heat's hot burns a lot.  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.  
  
White heat  
Red hot  
White heat

She looked good  
She looked hotter than hell  
All dressed in satins and lace  
I looked at her and it was just too clear  
I had to get on the case  
I said Lady, oh lady, can I take you home  
There's just so much we could do  
I'll take you all around the whole wide world  
Before the evening is through  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
You know she's gonna leave you well done  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
Burn you like the midday sun  
I asked her why she couldn't make up her mind  
She said You don't understand  
I'd love to go, but there's something you should know  
She showed me her wedding band  
Hot, hot, hotter than hell  
You know she's gonna leave you well done

Do you think you're gonna find it  
You got to treat yourself like number one  
Do you need to be reminded  
It doesn't matter what you do or say

We can't do it any other way  
Ev'rybody's got to rock n roll yay  
  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud  
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud  
  
If you don't feel good ev'ry way you could  
Don't sit there broken hearted  
Call all your friends in the neighborhood  
And get the party started  
Don't let them tell you that there's too much noise  
They're too old to really understand  
You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys  
Cause it's time for you to take a stand yay

I was swerving thru Queens  
Fully growin' benz  
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system  
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec  
Rappin' to my mens  
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly  
My shit is  
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow  
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice  
Crease my scar peice  
Laid back in my seat  
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets  
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge  
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college  
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne  
She lived on the southside, so bring things on  
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop  
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks  
  
Your carmake me hot hot hot  
You just make me just hot hot hot

Baby girl just stop stop stop  
Check this out, uh  
  
She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York  
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk  
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat  
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that  
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde  
Scooby dooby hizza  
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit  
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh  
I've got her right where I want her  
Reality about to creep up on her  
Stroke her softly, gently with my G  
While the light reflects off my icp  
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer  
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer  
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop  
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

You burst out of semi-???  
She pulled down the staps to her dress  
Reached in the ? sparked up sess  
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??  
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,  
and give up girl to push whips?""  
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone  
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone  
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????  
Give deep ? to ? man coats  
Take off my ??  
Drop to my knees""  
Talking in my face  
Breath smelling like cheese  
I asked her  
Shorty you degrade yourself  
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf  
You turnin' me off, I can't lie  
Keisha said ""why?""  
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,  
then he correct that""  
Ice is the price for an overnight wife  
A true shark caller don't want that in his life  
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls  
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold  
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll,  
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

on her lap it sat  
And once in a great big while  
it looked like that Cheshire cat did smile  
But often it used to chase  
anything that crossed it's face  
But one day it got so hot  
that Cheshire cat had a blood clot  
and she said  
  
Ooohhh-meow, me-meow  
Ooohhh-meow, me-meow  
  
Meow  
  
And then the dog met the cat  
the dog was hot and the cat was wet  
Then came some sweaty dude  
he put a board between the two  
Then they couldn't get at it  
got frustrated all about it  
So they did the only thing you could do  
they took the dude's sweat and shot it up between the two  
and they said  
  
Ooohhh-wow, bow-wow  
Ooohhh-wow, bow, me, wow

Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut  
Don't touch nobody with hate  
And if all you've got is poison in your mouth  
Make sure that you don't speak  
It's 3:30 in the early morning  
Don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite  
Try not to take the garbage of the day  
Any place but outside  
  
Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place  
And this fighting's gonna end  
And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat  
And stack you end to end

You want to be my main squeeze, baby  
Don't cha, you want to gimme what I need, baby  
Won't cha, picture life as my wife, just think  
Full length mink, fat X and O links  
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that  
Showed you the safe combinations and all that  
Guess you could say you's the one I trusted  
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?  
Shit got hot, you sent Feds to my spot  
Took me to court, tried to take all I got  
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her  
""Damn, why she want to stick me for my paper?""  
My Mo-sci-no ho, my Ver-sa-ce hottie  
Come to find out, you was fuckin' everybody  
You knew about me, the fake ID  
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.  
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'  
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin'  
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four  
All you heard was, ""Poppa, don't hit me no more""  
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial  
Fuck around and made her milk box material  
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips

Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep  
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet  
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite  
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down  
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound  
Now I'm Billboard now, niggas press to hit it  
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it  
Rather do the killin' than the stick up jooks  
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy  
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it  
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat  
Then, you want to be my main squeeze, nigga  
Don't cha, you want to lick between my knees, nigga  
Don't cha want to see me whippin' your three down the Ave.  
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad  
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air  
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere  
Me shifty? Now you want to pistol whip me  
Pull out your nine while I cock on mine  
Yeah, what, nigga? I ain't got time for this  
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit  
Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits  
Adia Vinadini and Chanel lime boots  
Things that make up for all the games and the lies  
Hallmark cards sayin', ""I apologize""  
Is you wit' me? How could you ever deceive me  
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me  
Naw, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow  
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know

Watched the ring on the stove turn red  
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee  
Pulled on my boots and made the bed  
Screen door hangin' off its hinges  
Kept bangin' me awake all night  
As I look out the window  
The only thing in sight  
Is dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind.  
  
I chased the heat of her blood  
Like it was the holy grail  
Descend beautiful spirit  
Into the evening pale  
Her appaloosa's  
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain  
There's a low thunder rolling  
'Cross the mesquite plain  
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I'd drive down to Alvarado Street  
Where she'd dance to make ends meet  
I'd spend the night over my gin  
As she'd talk to her men  
  
Well the piss yellow sun  
Comes bringin' up the day  
She said ""Ain't nobody can give nobody  
What they really need anyway.""  
  
Well you get so sick of the fightin'  
You lose your fear of the end  
But I can't lose your memory  
And the sweet smell of your skin  
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind

Rich may switch the way they feel rich  
But not the man who's alive  
Or the man who has drowned  
Keeping pound only makes sense  
If you're worth more than 99 pence Those who have a lot and those who have not  
Remain francs marks pesetas or cents  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound  
We'll be eating frogs and modeling clogs  
And you'll be hunting french  
And dutch with a hound  
Now a nation goes to the vote  
So our country has its name on the note  
Same set of people same boat  
Need their name in the back of their coat  
Heads or tails can't have been won  
On whose head graced whatever was spun  
If queen's head's not on money they've got  
It's still business and money's still fun  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound

Watched the ring on the stove turn to red  
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee  
Pulled on my boots and made the bed  
Screen door hangin' off its hinges  
Kept bangin' me awake all night  
As I look out the window  
The only thing in sight  
  
Is dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I chased the heat of her blood  
Like it was the holy grail  
Descend beautiful spirit  
Into the evening pale  
Her appaloosa's  
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain  
There's a low thunder rolling  
'Cross the mesquite plain  
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I'd drive down to Alvarado street  
Where she danced to make ends meet  
I'd spend the night over my gin  
As she'd talk to her men  
  
Well the piss yellow sun  
Comes bringin' up the day  
She said ""ain't nobody gonna give nobody  
What they really need anyway""  
  
Well you get so sick of the fightin'  
You lose your fear of the end  
But you can't lose your memory  
And the sweet smell of your skin  
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind

They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto, if you speak it then I'm with ya  
Any sideline nigga, they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me, yeah I'm ready, got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy I'm all about a chick  
She don't ask no questions, boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They don't hear me yet  
  
I'ma get that check, that money  
Y'all niggas out here funny  
You know y'all nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby  
I'ma fool with it though, too clumsy  
On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
I'm like eleven of them back, give me that fucking walkie talkie  
Then get lost cause when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
It's since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers, that's my killers, ain't gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)

You're a weekend warrior when  
You're one of the crowd  
But it's over, just look at you now  
  
You're not so brave the way you behave  
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick  
It's all bravado when you're out  
With your mates  
It's like a different person goes through  
Those gates  
And the game begins  
The adrenalin's high  
Feel the tension maybe someone  
Will die

Easy to stray  
You've gotta admit you're just  
Living a lie  
It didn't take long to work out why  
  
It's hard to say why you got involved  
Just wanting to be part  
Just wanting to belong

What you gonna do on Monday?

Baar baar samajha gaee  
Ro ke jawaani, kaati jisne  
Ro ke jawaani, kaati jisne  
Preet ke beej ye boye  
Ham kitana roye  
  
Kitane baadal gheere gagan men  
Gheer ke phir naa barase  
Pyaas daba kar dil hi dil men  
Kitana tadape, tarse  
Dard hamaara dil jaane, ya  
Dard hamaara dil jaane, ya  
Naina khoye, khoye  
Ham kitana roye  
  
Tum kya jaano, tumhaari yaad men  
Ham kitana roye  
Ham kitana roye

Leonard Cohen,/l/leonard+cohen/on+that+day_10164556.html,On That Day,"Some people say  
It's what we deserve  
For sins against g-d  
For crimes in the world  
I wouldn't know  
I'm just holding the fort  
Since that day  
They wounded New York  
Some people say  
They hate us of old  
Our women unveiled  
Our slaves and our gold  
I wouldn't know  
I'm just holding the fort  
But answer me this  
I won't take you to court  
Did you go crazy  
Or did you report  
On that day  
On that day  
They wounded New York

Lil Wayne,/l/lil+wayne/i+like+the+view_20980622.html,I Like The View,"I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""  
I'm so high I can't see you from here  
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me  
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy  
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em  
The weed too loud, turn up the volume  
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow  
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)  
  
God bless the world, and most people in it  
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning  
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning  
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish  
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society  
Now we get high-ya!, call that shit karate  
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy  
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side  
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover  
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover  
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right  
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight  
I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride  
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive  
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive  
Ever today that I took a walk outside  
  
I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot

Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow  
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)  
  
Ugh, and we all kiss our mommas  
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't a promise  
Think I'm getting sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal  
And not having money is the root of all evil  
Life is a midget so try to live it up  
It's Doctor Carter bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked  
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up  
I need some wallpaper, before they start the fuss  
Yeah, pick up the phone and call yo block  
Call Mitchell Carmone, now my pockets all bumped  
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough  
Motherfucker I don't shoot you, bitch I shoot ya up  
I ain't ride with these niggas, I don't like these niggas  
I just roll another joint, white spike with these niggas  
When I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes  
And then I took a walk outside  
  
And I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got

Stop playin'  
Run up in your fucking mouth nig'!  
I'm beside myself so that makes two of me,

Linkin Park,/l/linkin+park/rebellion_21084417.html,Rebellion,"[Verse 1]  
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken,  
The lost and the sights unseen.  
I want a flood, I want an ocean,  
To wash my confusion clean.  
I can't resolve this empty story,  
I can't repair the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We act it out, we wear the colors,  
Confined by the things we own.  
We're not without, we're like each other,  
Pretending we're here alone.  
And far away, they burn their buildings  
Right in the face of the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Bridge]  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
We lost before the start!  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
One by one we fall apart!  
We fall apart! We fall apart! We fall apart!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of, Imitations of...  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion.

That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have

Just sitting here trying not to look back

Night and morning with my tears

And with soft deceitful wiles  
  
And it grew both day and night  
Till it bore an apple bright  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine  
  
Was a poison tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree

Growing inside of me  
  
And into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole  
In the morning glad I see  
My foe outstretched  
Beneath that tree

With your feet on the ground

With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor  
She left her home in arkansas  
O poor mary bellows  
She wanted to see the deep blue sea  
She travelled across tennessee  
O poor mary bellows  
She met a man along the way  
He introduced himself as richard slade  
O poor mary bellows  
Poor mary thought that she might die  
When she saw the ocean for the first time  
O poor mary bellows  
She checked into a cheap little place  
Richard slade carried in her old suitcase  
O poor mary bellows  
I'm a good girl, sir, she said to him  
I couldn't possibly permit you in  
O poor mary bellows  
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye  
And turned away without goodbye  
O poor mary bellows  
She sat on her bed and thought of home  
With the sea breeze whistling all alone  
O poor mary bellows  
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor  
And undid the latch on the front door  
O poor mary bellows  
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed  
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
So mothers keep your girls at home  
Don't let them journey all alone  
Tell them this world is full of danger  
And to shun the company of strangers  
O poor mary bellows

They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row  
  
Generations, generations  
First they fight and then they forget  
What they were fighting about in the first place  
  
Here it comes, the big explosion  
Haven't I seen that once before  
Or is it just some deja vu  
Just some long forgotten dream  
Just some silly memory  
History does not repeat, it never, never does

I'm a walking testimony  
Just look at these holes, look at these holes!  
  
Generations, generations  
Fathers never teach their sons  
And grandpa never talked to them and so on  
  
Memories are inconvenient  
When there's lessons to be learned  
That just might rock the boat too much  
Cause anxiety and such  
We cannot walk without our crutches  
We cannot walk, we cannot walk, we never, never could

I know it's getting bad, you read it every day  
And you, you can try your best to fight it  
But you can't make it on your own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know, the bubble's just about to bust  
Tell them they'd better beware  
The word is on the street, get up on your feet, and shout out  
  
The kids out there don't know how to react  
The streets are getting tough and that's a matter of fact  
And I, I can't take it any longer  
But we can't make it on our own  
  
The people there find it hard to relate  
They don't know how it feels to be standing there on your own  
Believe me, it's never too late  
It's time to make a move, get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody, do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop  
  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
  
There are people who give and there are people who take  
But I believe it's gonna get better  
Realize what a difference you make  
And don't turn away, hey! I'm talking to you!  
  
So there's only the one solution  
Stop and think what's going on  
You can draw your own conclusions

Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol  
  
Hit her car

Pull her out  
Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down

There's just one thing  
We can do

Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down  
Drive her face out of town

I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff  
  
I'm hard to handle,  
Too hot to hold  
I can't seem to satisfy  
My heart an' soul  
I need a woman to set me free,  
A little Miss Understanding  
To feel the need in me  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight,  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough  
  
I'm ready for you,  
Are you ready for me  
I've got a burning heart,  
It won't let me be  
I feel the hunger, my spirit yearns,  
I've got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff  
  
Hot stuff, can't get enough hot stuff

An' soothe your troubled mind  
With a little bit of this,  
An' a little bit of that  
I'll make you leave all your worries behind

An' he wants you hanging on a line,

Someone is spending my money for me,  
The money I earn I never see,  
In all things I do he interferes,  
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears.  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
When I drink my potion my character changes,  
My whole mind and body rearranges,  
This strange transformation takes place in me,  
Instead of myself everybody can see...  
  
Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Mister Hyde, Hyde.  
Whenever you're with me make sure it's still me,  
I've got to the stage I can't tell which I'll be,  
The loveable fellow who'll buy you a drink,  
Then when he's drunk his he'll change in a wink into...

When there asleep  
I'll cover my face  
I'll break the lock, open the door  
I'll slip inside, I'll rob the store  
Then I'll be a man with lots of money

Who,/w/who/silas+stingy_20146634.html,Silas Stingy,"Once upon a time there lived an old miser man  
By the name of Silas Stingy  
He carried all his money in a little black box  
Which was heavy as a rock  
With a big padlock  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus:]  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
  
Silas didn't eat, which was just as well  
He would starve himself for a penny  
He wore old clothes and he never washed  
'Cause soap cost a lot  
And the dirt kept him hot  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus]  
In the back of his head  
Was a voice that said  
""Someone will steal it all  
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box  
The thieves will be having a ball""  
  
[Chorus]  
He bought a safe to put the box in  
And a house to put the safe in  
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure  
And his face was very funny  
When he counted up his money  
And he realized he hadn't any more  
  
[Chorus]

It's too hot in New York man, yeah  
It's too hot in New York man, give me  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet  
It's too hot in New York I had to get away  
So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
'Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home, mama whooped on my ass  
Said I'll be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin'  
Beatin' on his wife while the kids were watchin'  
Later that day we was out on the porch  
And fantasize we was out of New York, we woke up in  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day

I'm in your hood like your neighbors were Spiderman  
I'm in the club 'fore I entered the stadium  
I bring the vibe like the days of the Tribe  
Before I had the fame I was servin' the fries  
So who better to know about a nine-to-five  
Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes  
Now my daddy, he can rest in peace  
From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach, let's go  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
  
Playin' my guitar, used to daydream at the stars  
Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?  
I'm a stand on stage and play this guitar till I fall  
Santana, let me get some help  
Santana, let me get some help  
  
Eh, this one goes out to those who work, follow and ?  
Keep your head up, 'cause if I made it, you can make it too one day
