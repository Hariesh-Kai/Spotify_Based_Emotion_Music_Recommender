Gut ist alles, was jemand liebt, es ist gut, dass du bei mir bist  
  
  
Da ist ein Mann, der lebt fuer seine Rosen  
Sie sind das Glueck fuer ihn, schoen, dass Blumen blueh'n  
Und eine Dame malt jeden Tag ein Bild  
Nur aus Freude dran, schoen, dass sie das kann  
Und da bin ich und denke an uns zwei und hoere unser Lied

INXS,/i/inxs/im+just+a+man_20067757.html,I'm Just A Man,"I'm just a man  
My will is so strong  
When I've got plans  
I close my eyes to the pain  
My mother ran  
My father left town  
But we still have  
What's necessary to go on  
Flesh and blood  
Flesh and blood  
  
I'm part of you  
You're part of me  
There's nothing said  
That cannot be undone  
  
My brothers sane  
His heart is so strong  
He's killed some pain  
To himself nearly did the same  
It washed away  
Into the cruel sea  
Like everything  
That's built upon the sand  
  
Flesh and blood  
Flesh and blood  
  
Sweet sister T  
She loved so long and hard  
Kept to herself  
Until that right man came along  
Some men they lie  
Some men they cheat  
But now she's found  
Someone to be as strong  
  
I'm just a man  
My will is so strong  
When I've got plans  
I close my eyes to the pain  
My Father ran (Flesh and blood)  
My Mother left town  
But we still have (Flesh and blood)  
What's necessary to go on  
  
I'm part of you  
Your part of me

Johnny Cash,/j/johnny+cash/flesh+and+blood_20194897.html,Flesh And Blood,"Beside a singing mountain stream  
Where the willow grew  
  
Where the silver leaf of maple  
Sparkled in the morning dew  
I braided twigs of willows  
Made a string of buckeye beads  
But flesh and blood needs flesh And blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
  
I leaned against a bark of birch  
And I breathed the honey dew  
I saw a North-bound flock of geese  
Against a sky of baby blue  
Beside the lily pads  
I carved a whistle from a reed  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
A cardinal sang just for me  
And I thanked him for the song  
Then the sun went slowly down the west  
And I had to move along  
These were some of the things  
  
On which my mind and spirit feed  
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
So when this day was ended  
I was still not satisfied  
For I knew everything I touched  
Would wither and would die  
And love is all that will remain  
And grow from all these seeds  
  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.

Train,/t/train/lincoln+avenue_10235616.html,Lincoln Avenue,"Well I guess this is where I left my life  
And all its operations  
And I know that I will never get this twice  
With all negotiations  
  
This feels like the place between what is and might have been  
So I guess this is where we both find out  
If this was meant to be  
And I'll tell myself, I don't need you  
I'll tell myself enough to get me through  
But I'll finally show you how I should have been being with you every day  
If you can take a little more  
  
Now it takes me back to times on Lincoln Avenue  
When you said you'd never get tired of the boy  
That seemed to be so far from growing up  
But we were different then  
  
This feels like the place between being ready and being in the way  
And I'll tell myself, I don't need you  
I'll tell myself enough to get me through  
But I'll finally show you how I should have been being with you every day  
If you can wait a little more  
  
This feels like the time that I'm ready for you  
Are you ready for me  
Cause I'll tell myself I'll make it through  
I'll tell myself anything to get over you  
  
And I won't blame you but I'm finally ready to show you  
That I'm ready to show you, I'm ready to show you, yeah  
I'll tell myself that I never needed anybody anyway, but anyway  
I need you  
I need you now  
I need you now  
I'm ready now

Well, we tried to hold 'em back  
Tried to ward off their attack  
But our atom bombs were just no use  
  
They were ugly, they were mean  
Biggest heads I ever seen  
They made everybody scream and shout  
  
First they leveled Tokyo  
Then New York was next to go  
Boy I really wish they'd cut it out  
  
They wasted everybody on my block  
There goes the neighborhood  
They'll zap you with their death ray eyes  
And blow you up real good

They got slimy lizard skin  
And an evil lookin' grin  
And they sure could use some manicures  
  
They got hands all covered with fungus  
They got eyes like some kinda bug  
I sure hope they don't come in here

When I first set my eyes on you,  
I'll never forget the thrill of it all  
Dreaming of the things we could do  
Baby, you must be crazy,  
Fooling with a man like me,  
'cause I roll my dice with a heart of ice  
An' make it clear to see

Can take the pain away,  
The things that you do make a queen out of you  
An' make me a king for a day

I want to start fresh, like a baby in a sink  
Scrub away all these thoughts that I think of you  
  
So life moves slowly when you're waiting for it to boil,  
Feel like I watch from six feet under the soil  
Still, want to hold you and kiss behind your ears,  
But I recount the countless tears that I lost for you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
I want to crawl back inside my bed of sin  
I want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin  
Instead I'll wash them just like kitchen rags with stains  
Spinning away every piece that remains of you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world

Spit it out  
If you get so angry that you cannot speak  
Spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And tell them where they can put it  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you get worked over at your job  
Spit it out  
If a taxi almost runs you down  
Spit it out  
You got to take aim with your mouth and speak  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you're patient and you have the time  
Spit it out  
Wait till they're on the decline  
Spit it out  
The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft  
The Yin with the Yang  
The down with the up, oh  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to grab that dumb he, she, or it  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
Spit it out, babe, spit it out

And the stars wash down the sink  
I am the king of the blues  
I scape the clay off my shoes  
And wade down the gutter and the moon  
The moon blinds my eye with opal cataracts  
As I cut through the saw-mills and the stacks,  
Leaping over the gully where I would one day take Lucy  
Then wash up my hands in the gully and the moon.  
Such a long way from home, just me and  
The moon is in the gutter  
All my plans are flushed down the drain  
I wander lonely as a cloud  
Over memories at her mound  
Then lie down in the bitter gutter moon.

But I'm stayin' high  
  
I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green  
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B (and then I'm gone)  
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?  
  
Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion  
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?  
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up ('til it's all gone)  
  
Get a pound, break it down, I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around  
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on  
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull, and hold on (and then, I'm gone)  
  
I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about  
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out  
My eyes low, have me chiefin' 'til I choke  
Niggas askin' me what's wrong,  
Blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone  
  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
  
I said I'm gone, off that brownish drank  
Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed  
Hennesey and Hydro, rhyme slow  
  
Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe  
This a different type of weed,  
And I'm a different type a high (my nigga, I'm gone)  
To a place that you probably never been in life  
  
Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right  
'Cause I ain't tryna have this home-grown runnin',  
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free,  
I duck 'em, roll somethin' (then, I'm gone)  
  
In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone  
Got me blown, I get more than high  
  
Fresh off of the plane  
Head straight into my hotel  
Weed man in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)  
  
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds  
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down  
My eyes low, and my words are getting slow  
Niggas askin' me whats wrong,  
I blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone  
  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low
